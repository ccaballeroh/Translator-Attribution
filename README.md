# TranslatorAttribution
Repository for holding all the files necessary of my master's project

For my thesis project, I want to attribute the translator of a text to its translator using linguitics-inspired features.
The corpora comprises works by Norwegian playwright, Henrik Ibsen, and Spanish writer, Miguel de Cervantes. For the Ibsen corpus,
there are parallel works translated by two people, whereas the Cervantes corpus is composed of three translations. All the texts are
in the `Corpora` both in raw format and preprocessed.

The file structure in the computer is as follows:  

  \auxfiles  
  \Corpora  
  \helper  
  \Network motifs paper  
  \pan17-author-clustering-training-dataset-2017-02-15  
  \results  
  \Trash  
  *.ipynb  
  
  Files from the `auxfiles`, `Network motifs paper`, `pan17-author-clustering-training-dataset-2017-02-15`, and `Trash` folders are not
  under version control due to their size. However, all the code necessary is along with the text files used.
