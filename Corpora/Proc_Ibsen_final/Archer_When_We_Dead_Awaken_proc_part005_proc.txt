 THE INSPECTOR. [With a show of sympathy.] Oh--that is a pity. But after a few weeks' stay at the Baths--you will quite get over that. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Looking up at him.] Tell me, Inspector--are any of your patients in the habit of taking baths during the night? THE INSPECTOR. [Astonished.] During the night? No, I have never heard of such a thing. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Have you not? THE INSPECTOR. No, I don't know of any one so ill as to require such treatment. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Well, at any rate there is some one who is in the habit of walking about the park by night? THE INSPECTOR. [Smiling and shaking his head.] No, Professor--that would be against the rules. MAIA. [Impatiently.] Good Heavens, Rubek, I told you so this morning--you must have dreamt it. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Drily.] Indeed? Must I? Thank you! [Turning to the INSPECTOR.] The fact is, I got up last night--I couldn't sleep--and I wanted to see what sort of night it was-- THE INSPECTOR. [Attentively.] To be sure--and then--? PROFESSOR RUBEK. I looked out at the window--and caught sight of a white figure in there among the trees. MAIA. [Smiling to the INSPECTOR.] And the Professor declares that the figure was dressed in a bathing costume-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. --or something like it, I said. Couldn't distinguish very clearly. But I am sure it was something white. THE INSPECTOR. Most remarkable. Was it a gentleman or a lady? PROFESSOR RUBEK. I could almost have sworn it was a lady. But then after it came another figure. And that one was quite dark--like a shadow--. THE INSPECTOR. [Starting.] A dark one? Quite black, perhaps? PROFESSOR RUBEK. Yes, I should almost have said so. THE INSPECTOR. [A light breaking in upon him.] And behind the white figure? Following close upon her--? PROFESSOR RUBEK. Yes--at a little distance-- THE INSPECTOR. Aha! Then I think I can explain the mystery, Professor. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Well, what was it then? MAIA. [Simultaneously.] Was the professor really not dreaming? THE INSPECTOR. [Suddenly whispering, as he directs their attention towards the background on the right.] Hush, if you please! Look there--don't speak loud for a moment. [A slender lady, dressed in fine, cream-white cashmere, and followed by a SISTER OF MERCY in black, with a silver cross hanging by a chain on her breast, comes forward from behind the hotel and crosses the park towards the pavilion in front on the left. Her face is pale, and its lines seem to have stiffened; the eyelids are drooped and the eyes appear as though they saw nothing. Her dress comes down to her feet and clings to the body in perpendicular folds. Over her head, neck, breast, shoulders and arms she wears a large shawl of white crape. She keeps her arms crossed upon her breast. She carries her body immovably, and her steps are stiff and measured. The SISTER's bearing is also measured, and she has the air of a servant. She keeps her brown piercing eyes incessantly fixed upon the lady. WAITERS, with napkins on their arms, come forward in the hotel doorway, and cast curious glances at the strangers, who take no notice of anything, and, without looking round, enter the pavilion. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Has risen slowly and involuntarily, and stands staring at the closed door of the pavilion.] Who was that lady? THE INSPECTOR. She is a stranger who has rented the little pavilion there. PROFESSOR RUBEK. A foreigner? THE INSPECTOR. Presumably. At any rate they both came from abroad--about a week ago. They have never been here before. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Decidedly; looking at him.] It was she I saw in the park last night. THE INSPECTOR. No doubt it must have been. I thought so from the first. PROFESSOR RUBEK. What is this lady's name, Inspector? THE INSPECTOR. She has registered herself as "Madame de Satow, with companion." We know nothing more. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Reflecting.] Satow? Satow--? MAIA. [Laughing mockingly.] Do you know any one of that name, Rubek? Eh? PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Shaking his head.] No, no one.--Satow? It sounds Russian--or in all events Slavonic. [To the INSPECTOR.] What language does she speak? THE INSPECTOR. When the two ladies talk to each other, it is in a language I cannot make out at all. But at other times she speaks Norwegian like a native. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Exclaims with a start.] Norwegian? You are sure you are not mistaken? THE INSPECTOR. No, how could I be mistaken in that? PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Looks at him with eager interest.] You have heard her yourself? THE INSPECTOR. Yes. I myself have spoken to her--several times.--Only a few words, however; she is far from communicative. But-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. But Norwegian it was? THE INSPECTOR. Thoroughly good Norwegian--perhaps with a little north-country accent. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Gazing straight before him in amazement, whispers.] That too?
