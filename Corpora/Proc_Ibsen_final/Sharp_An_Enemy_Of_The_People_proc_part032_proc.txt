consistently done nothing but fume at being so unconscionably heavily taxed. But are you perfectly certain of this, Peter? Peter Stockmann. I have it from an absolutely reliable source. Dr. Stockmann. Then, thank God, Katherine is provided for--and the children too! I must tell her this at once--(calls out) Katherine, Katherine! Peter Stockmann (restraining him). Hush, don't say a word yet! Mrs. Stockmann (opening the door). What is the matter? Dr. Stockmann. Oh, nothing, nothing; you can go back. (She shuts the door. DR. STOCKMANN walks up and down in his excitement.) Provided for!--Just think of it, we are all provided for! And for life! What a blessed feeling it is to know one is provided for! Peter Stockmann. Yes, but that is just exactly what you are not. Mr. Kiil can alter his will any day he likes. Dr. Stockmann. But he won't do that, my dear Peter. The "Badger" is much too delighted at my attack on you and your wise friends. Peter Stockmann (starts and looks intently at him). Ah, that throws a light on various things. Dr. Stockmann. What things? Peter Stockmann. I see that the whole thing was a combined manoeuvre on your part and his. These violent, reckless attacks that you have made against the leading men of the town, under the pretence that it was in the name of truth-- Dr. Stockmann. What about them? Peter Stockmann. I see that they were nothing else than the stipulated price for that vindictive old man's will. Dr. Stockmann (almost speechless). Peter--you are the most disgusting plebeian I have ever met in all my life. Peter Stockmann. All is over between us. Your dismissal is irrevocable--we have a weapon against you now. (Goes out.) Dr. Stockmann. For shame! For shame! (Calls out.) Katherine, you must have the floor scrubbed after him! Let--what's her name--devil take it, the girl who has always got soot on her nose-- Mrs. Stockmann. (in the sitting-room). Hush, Thomas, be quiet! Petra (coming to the door). Father, grandfather is here, asking if he may speak to you alone. Dr. Stockmann. Certainly he may. (Going to the door.) Come in, Mr. Kiil. (MORTEN KIIL comes in. DR. STOCKMANN shuts the door after him.) What can I do for you? Won't you sit down? Morten Kiil. I won't sit. (Looks around.) You look very comfortable here today, Thomas. Dr. Stockmann. Yes, don't we! Morten Kiil. Very comfortable--plenty of fresh air. I should think you have got enough to-day of that oxygen you were talking about yesterday. Your conscience must be in splendid order to-day, I should think. Dr. Stockmann. It is. Morten Kiil. So I should think. (Taps his chest.) Do you know what I have got here? Dr. Stockmann. A good conscience, too, I hope. Morten Kiil. Bah!--No, it is something better than that. (He takes a thick pocket-book from his breast-pocket, opens it, and displays a packet of papers.) Dr. Stockmann (looking at him in astonishment). Shares in the Baths? Morten Kiil. They were not difficult to get today. Dr. Stockmann. And you have been buying--? Morten Kiil. As many as I could pay for. Dr. Stockmann. But, my dear Mr. Kiil--consider the state of the Baths' affairs! Morten Kiil. If you behave like a reasonable man, you can soon set the Baths on their feet again. Dr. Stockmann. Well, you can see for yourself that I have done all I can, but--. They are all mad in this town! Morten Kiil. You said yesterday that the worst of this pollution came from my tannery. If that is true, then my grandfather and my father before me, and I myself, for many years past, have been poisoning the town like three destroying angels. Do you think I am going to sit quiet under that reproach? Dr. Stockmann. Unfortunately I am afraid you will have to. Morten Kiil. No, thank you. I am jealous of my name and reputation. They call me "the Badger," I am told. A badger is a kind of pig, I believe; but I am not going to give them the right to call me that. I mean to live and die a clean man. Dr. Stockmann. And how are you going to set about it? Morten Kiil. You shall cleanse me, Thomas. Dr. Stockmann. I! Morten Kiil. Do you know what money I have bought these shares with? No, of course you can't know--but I will tell you. It is the money that Katherine and Petra and the boys will have when I am gone. Because I have been able to save a little bit after all, you know. Dr. Stockmann (flaring up). And you have gone and taken Katherine's money for this! Morten Kiil. Yes, the whole of the money is invested in the Baths now. And now I just want to see whether you are quite stark, staring mad, Thomas! If you still make out that these animals and other nasty things of that sort come from my tannery, it will be exactly as if you were to flay broad strips of skin from Katherine's body, and Petra's, and the boys'; and no decent man would do that--unless he were mad. Dr. Stockmann (walking up and down). Yes, but I am mad; I am mad! Morten Kiil. You cannot be so absurdly mad as all that, when it is a question of your wife and children.
