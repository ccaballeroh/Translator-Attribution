judgment he respects. He frankly admitted as much when he last came to see me. REGINA. Yes, he mentioned something of the sort to me. But I don't know whether Mrs. Alving can spare me; especially now that we've got the new Orphanage to attend to. And then I should be so sorry to leave Mrs. Alving; she has always been so kind to me. MANDERS. But a daughter's duty, my good girl--Of course, we should first have to get your mistress's consent. REGINA. But I don't know whether it would be quite proper for me, at my age, to keep house for a single man. MANDERS. What! My dear Miss Engstrand! When the man is your own father! REGINA. Yes, that may be; but all the same--Now, if it were in a thoroughly nice house, and with a real gentleman-- MANDERS. Why, my dear Regina-- REGINA.--one I could love and respect, and be a daughter to-- MANDERS. Yes, but my dear, good child-- REGINA. Then I should be glad to go to town. It's very lonely out here; you know yourself, sir, what it is to be alone in the world. And I can assure you I'm both quick and willing. Don't you know of any such place for me, sir? MANDERS. I? No, certainly not. REGINA. But, dear, dear Sir, do remember me if-- MANDERS. [Rising.] Yes, yes, certainly, Miss Engstrand. REGINA. For if I-- MANDERS. Will you be so good as to tell your mistress I am here? REGINA. I will, at once, sir. [She goes out to the left.] MANDERS. [Paces the room two or three times, stands a moment in the background with his hands behind his back, and looks out over the garden. Then he returns to the table, takes up a book, and looks at the title-page; starts, and looks at several books.] Ha--indeed! [MRS. ALVING enters by the door on the left; she is followed by REGINA, who immediately goes out by the first door on the right.] MRS. ALVING. [Holds out her hand.] Welcome, my dear Pastor. MANDERS. How do you do, Mrs. Alving? Here I am as I promised. MRS. ALVING. Always punctual to the minute. MANDERS. You may believe it was not so easy for me to get away. With all the Boards and Committees I belong to-- MRS. ALVING. That makes it all the kinder of you to come so early. Now we can get through our business before dinner. But where is your portmanteau? MANDERS. [Quickly.] I left it down at the inn. I shall sleep there to-night. MRS. ALVING. [Suppressing a smile.] Are you really not to be persuaded, even now, to pass the night under my roof? MANDERS. No, no, Mrs. Alving; many thanks. I shall stay at the inn, as usual. It is so conveniently near the landing-stage. MRS. ALVING. Well, you must have your own way. But I really should have thought we two old people-- MANDERS. Now you are making fun of me. Ah, you're naturally in great spirits to-day--what with to-morrow's festival and Oswald's return. MRS. ALVING. Yes; you can think what a delight it is to me! It's more than two years since he was home last. And now he has promised to stay with me all the winter. MANDERS. Has he really? That is very nice and dutiful of him. For I can well believe that life in Rome and Paris has very different attractions from any we can offer here. MRS. ALVING. Ah, but here he has his mother, you see. My own darling boy--he hasn't forgotten his old mother! MANDERS. It would be grievous indeed, if absence and absorption in art and that sort of thing were to blunt his natural feelings. MRS. ALVING. Yes, you may well say so. But there's nothing of that sort to fear with him. I'm quite curious to see whether you know him again. He'll be down presently; he's upstairs just now, resting a little on the sofa. But do sit down, my dear Pastor. MANDERS. Thank you. Are you quite at liberty--? MRS. ALVING. Certainly. [She sits by the table.] MANDERS. Very well. Then let me show you--[He goes to the chair where his travelling-bag lies, takes out a packet of papers, sits down on the opposite side of the table, and tries to find a clear space for the papers.] Now, to begin with, here is--[Breaking off.] Tell me, Mrs. Alving, how do these books come to be here? MRS. ALVING. These books? They are books I am reading. MANDERS. Do you read this sort of literature? MRS. ALVING. Certainly I do. MANDERS. Do you feel better or happier for such reading? MRS. ALVING. I feel, so to speak, more secure. MANDERS. That is strange. How do you mean? MRS. ALVING. Well, I seem to find explanation and confirmation of all sorts of things I myself have been thinking. For that is the wonderful part of it, Pastor Manders--there is really nothing new in these books, nothing but what most people think and believe. Only most people either don't formulate it to themselves, or else keep quiet about it. MANDERS. Great heavens! Do you really believe that most people--? MRS. ALVING. I do, indeed. MANDERS. But surely not in this country? Not here among us? MRS. ALVING. Yes, certainly; here as elsewhere. MANDERS. Well, I really must say--! MRS. ALVING. For the rest, what do you object to in these books? MANDERS. Object to in them? You surely do not suppose that I have
