 ULFHEIM. And then he took the girl up with him--? MAIA. [With a toss of the head.] Took her up with him finely, you may be sure! Oh no! he beguiled her into a cold, clammy cage, where--as it seemed to her--there was neither sunlight nor fresh air, but only gilding and great petrified ghosts of people all around the walls. ULFHEIM. Devil take me, but it served her right! MAIA. Yes, but don't you think it's quite a comical story, all the same? ULFHEIM. [Looks at her moment.] Now listen to me, my good companion of the chase-- MAIA. Well, what it is now? ULFHEIM. Should not we two tack our poor shreds of life together? MAIA. Is his worship inclined to set up as a patching-tailor? ULFHEIM. Yes, indeed he is. Might not we two try to draw the rags together here and there--so as to make some sort of a human life out of them? MAIA. And when the poor tatters were quite worn out--what then? ULFHEIM. [With a large gesture.] Then there we shall stand, free and serene--as the man and woman we really are! MAIA. [Laughing.] You with your goat-legs yes! ULFHEIM. And you with your--. Well, let that pass. MAIA. Yes, come--let us pass--on. ULFHEIM. Stop! Whither away, comrade? MAIA. Down to the hotel, of course. ULFHEIM. And afterward? MAIA. Then we'll take a polite leave of each other, with thanks for pleasant company. ULFHEIM. Can we part, we two? Do you think we can? MAIA. Yes, you didn't manage to tie me up, you know. ULFHEIM. I have a castle to offer you-- MAIA. [Pointing to the hut.] A fellow to that one? ULFHEIM. It has not fallen to ruin yet. MAIA. And all the glory of the world, perhaps? ULFHEIM. A castle, I tell you-- MAIA. Thanks! I have had enough of castles. ULFHEIM. --with splendid hunting-grounds stretching for miles around it. MAIA. Are there works of art too in this castle? ULFHEIM. [Slowly.] Well, no--it's true there are no works of art; but-- MAIA. [Relieved.] Ah! that's one good thing, at any rate! ULFHEIM. Will you go with me, then--as far and as long as I want you? MAIA. There is a tame bird of prey keeping watch upon me. ULFHEIM. [Wildly.] We'll put a bullet in his wing, Maia! MAIA. [Looks at him a moment, and says resolutely.] Come then, and carry me down into the depths. ULFHEIM. [Puts his arm round her waist.] It is high time! The mist is upon us! MAIA. Is the way down terribly dangerous? ULFHEIM. The mountain is more dangerous still. [She shakes him off, goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over, but starts quickly back. ULFHEIM. [Goes towards her, laughing.] What? Does it make you a little giddy? MAIA. [Faintly.] Yes, that too. But go and look over. Those two, coming up-- ULFHEIM. [Goes and bends over the edge of the precipice.] It's only your bird of prey--and his strange lady. MAIA. Can't we get past them--without their seeing us? ULFHEIM. Impossible! The path is far too narrow. And there's no other way down. MAIA. [Nerving herself.] Well, well--let us face them here, then! ULFHEIM. Spoken like a true bear-killer, comrade! [PROFESSOR RUBEK and IRENE appear over the edge of the precipice at the back. He has his plaid over his shoulders; she has a fur cloak thrown loosely over her white dress, and a swansdown hood over her head. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Still only half visible above the edge.] What, Maia! So we two meet once again? MAIA. [With assumed coolness.] At your service. Won't you come up? [PROFESSOR RUBEK climbs right up and holds out his hand to IRENE, who also comes right to the top. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Coldly to MAIA.] So you, too, have been all night on the mountain,--as we have? MAIA. I have been hunting--yes. You gave me permission, you know. ULFHEIM. [Pointing downward.] Have you come up that path there? PROFESSOR RUBEK. As you saw. ULFHEIM. And the strange lady too? PROFESSOR RUBEK. Yes, of course. [With a glance at MAIA.] Henceforth the strange lady and I do not intend our ways to part. ULFHEIM. Don't you know, then, that it is a deadly dangerous way you have come? PROFESSOR RUBEK. We thought we would try it, nevertheless. For it did not seem particularly hard at first. ULFHEIM. No, at first nothing seems hard. But presently you may come to a tight place where you can neither get forward nor back. And then you stick fast, Professor! Mountain-fast, as we hunters call it. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Smiles and looks at him.] Am I to take these as oracular utterances, Mr. Ulfheim? ULFHEIM. Lord preserve me from playing the oracle! [Urgently, pointing up towards the heights.] But don't you see that the storm is upon us? Don't you hear the blasts of wind? PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Listening.] They sound like the prelude to the Resurrection Day. ULFHEIM. They are storm-blasts form the peaks, man! Just look how the clouds are rolling and sinking--soon they'll be all around us like a winding-sheet!
