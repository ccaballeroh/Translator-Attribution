 ASTA. Oh, yes--pretty well. [She puts down her umbrella and lays the flowers upon a chair.] BORGHEIM. Miss Allmers has been very silent during our walk. RITA. Indeed, has she? Well, Alfred and I have talked things out thoroughly enough-- ASTA. [Looking eagerly at both of them.] What is this--? RITA. Enough to last all our lifetime, I say. [Breaking off.] Come now, let us go up to the house, all four of us. We must have company about us in future. It will never do for Alfred and me to be alone. ALLMERS. Yes, do you go ahead, you two. [Turning.] I must speak a word to you before we go, Asta. RITA. [Looking at him.] Indeed? Well then, you come with me, Mr. Borgheim. [RITA and BORGHEIM go up the wood-path.] ASTA. [Anxiously.] Alfred, what is the matter? ALLMERS. [Darkly.] Only that I cannot endure to be here any more. ASTA. Here! With Rita, do you mean? ALLMERS. Yes. Rita and I cannot go on living together. ASTA. [Seizes his arm and shakes it.] Oh, Alfred--don't say anything so terrible! ALLMERS. It is the truth. I am telling you. We are making each other wicked and hateful. ASTA. [With painful emotion.] I had never--never dreamt of anything like this! ALLMERS. I did not realise it either, till to-day. ASTA. And now you want to--! What is it you really want, Alfred? ALLMERS. I want to get away from everything here--far, far away from it all. ASTA. And to stand quite alone in the world? ALLMERS. [Nods.] As I used to, before, yes. ASTA. But you are not fitted for living alone! ALLMERS. Oh, yes. I was so in the old days, at any rate. ASTA. In the old days, yes; for then you had me with you. ALLMERS. [Trying to take her hand.] Yes. And it is to you, Asta, that I now want to come home again. ASTA. [Eluding him.] To me! No, no, Alfred! That is quite impossible. ALLMERS. [Looks sadly at her.] Then Borgheim stands in the way after all? ASTA. [Earnestly.] No, no; he does not! That is quite a mistake! ALLMERS. Good. Then I will come to you--my dear, dear sister. I must come to you again--home to you, to be purified and ennobled after my life with-- ASTA. [Shocked.] Alfred,--you are doing Rita a great wrong! ALLMERS. I have done her a great wrong. But not in this. Oh, think of it, Asta--think of our life together, yours and mine. Was it not like one long holy-day from first to last? ASTA. Yes, it was, Alfred. But we can never live it over again. ALLMERS. [Bitterly.] Do you mean that marriage has so irreparably ruined me? ASTA. [Quietly.] No, that is not what I mean. ALLMERS. Well, then we two will live our old life over again. ASTA. [With decision.] We cannot, Alfred. ALLMERS. Yes, we can. For the love of a brother and sister-- ASTA. [Eagerly.] What of it? ALLMERS. That is the only relation in life that is not subject to the law of change. ASTA. [Softly and tremblingly.] But if that relation were not-- ALLMERS. Not--? ASTA.--not our relation? ALLMERS. [Stares at her in astonishment.] Not ours? Why, what can you mean by that? ASTA. It is best I should tell you at once, Alfred. ALLMERS. Yes, yes; tell me! ASTA. The letters to mother--. Those in my portfolio-- ALLMERS. Well? ASTA. You must read them--when I am gone. ALLMERS. Why must I? ASTA. [Struggling with herself.] For then you will see that-- ALLMERS. Well? ASTA.--that I have no right to bear your father's name. ALLMERS. [Staggering backwards.] Asta! What is this you say! ASTA. Read the letters. Then you will see--and understand. And perhaps have some forgiveness--for mother, too. ALLMERS. [Clutching at his forehead.] I cannot grasp this--I cannot realise the thought. You, Asta--you are not-- ASTA. You are not my brother, Alfred. ALLMERS. [Quickly, half defiantly, looking at her.] Well, but what difference does that really make in our relation? Practically none at all. ASTA. [Shaking her head.] It makes all the difference, Alfred. Our relation is not that of brother and sister. ALLMERS. No, no. But it is none the less sacred for that--it will always be equally sacred. ASTA. Do not forget--that it is subject to the law of change, as you said just now. ALLMERS. [Looks inquiringly at her.] Do you mean that-- ASTA. [Quietly, but with rearm emotion.] Not a word more--my dear, dear Alfred. [Takes up the flowers from the chair.] Do you see these water-lilies? ALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] They are the sort that shoot up--from the very depth. ASTA. I pulled them in the tarn--where it flows out into the fiord. [Holds them out to him.] Will you take them, Alfred? ALLMERS. [Taking them.] Thanks. ASTA. [With tears in her eyes.] They are a last greeting to you, from--from little Eyolf. ALLMERS. [Looking at her.] From Eyolf out yonder? Or from you? ASTA. [Softly.] From both of us. [Taking up her umbrella.] Now come with me to Rita. [She goes up the wood-path.] ALLMERS. [Takes up his hat from the table, and whispers sadly.] Asta. Eyolf. Little Eyolf--! [He follows her up the path.] ACT THIRD [An elevation, overgrown with shrubs, in ALLMERS'S garden. At the back
