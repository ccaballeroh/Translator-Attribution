 MAIA. [A little hurt and jarred.] Perhaps this lady has been one of your models, Rubek? Search your memory. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Looks cuttingly at her.] My models? MAIA. [With a provoking smile.] In your younger days, I mean. You are said to have had innumerable models--long ago, of course. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [In the same tone.] Oh no, little Frau Maia. I have in reality had only one single model. One and only one--for everything I have done. THE INSPECTOR. [Who has turned away and stands looking out to the left.] If you'll excuse me, I think I will take my leave. I see some one coming whom it is not particularly agreeable to meet. Especially in the presence of ladies. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Looking in the same direction.] That sportsman there? Who is it? THE INSPECTOR. It is a certain Mr. Ulfheim, from-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. Oh, Mr. Ulfheim-- THE INSPECTOR. --the bear-killer, as they call him-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. I know him. THE INSPECTOR. Who does not know him? PROFESSOR RUBEK. Very slightly, however. Is he on your list of patients--at last? THE INSPECTOR. No, strangely enough--not as yet. He comes here only once a year--on his way up to his hunting-grounds.--Excuse me for the moment-- [Makes a movement to go into the hotel. ULFHEIM's VOICE. [Heard outside.] Stop a moment, man! Devil take it all, can't you stop? Why do you always scuttle away from me? THE INSPECTOR. [Stops.] I am not scuttling at all, Mr. Ulfheim. [ULFHEIM enters from the left followed by a servant with a couple of sporting dogs in leash. ULFHEIM is in shooting costume, with high boots and a felt hat with a feather in it. He is a long, lank, sinewy personage, with matted hair and beard, and a loud voice. His appearance gives no precise clue to his age, but he is no longer young.] ULFHEIM. [Pounces upon the INSPECTOR.] Is this a way to receive strangers, hey? You scamper away with your tail between your legs--as if you had the devil at your heels. THE INSPECTOR. [Calmly, without answering him.] Has Mr. Ulfheim arrived by the steamer? ULFHEIM. [Growls.] Haven't had the honour of seeing any steamer. [With his arms akimbo.] Don't you know that I sail my own cutter? [To the SERVANT.] Look well after your fellow-creatures, Lars. But take care you keep them ravenous, all the same. Fresh meat-bones--but not too much meat on them, do you hear? And be sure it's reeking raw, and bloody. And get something in your own belly while you're about it. [Aiming a kick at him.] Now then, go to hell with you! [The SERVANT goes out with the dogs, behind the corner of the hotel.] THE INSPECTOR. Would not Mr. Ulfheim like to go into the dining-room in the meantime? ULFHEIM. In among all the half-dead flies and people? No, thank you a thousand times, Mr. Inspector. THE INSPECTOR. Well, well, as you please. ULFHEIM. But get the housekeeper to prepare a hamper for me as usual. There must be plenty of provender in it--and lots of brandy--! You can tell her that I or Lars will come and play Old Harry with her if she doesn't-- THE INSPECTOR. [Interrupting.] We know your ways of old. [Turning.] Can I give the waiter any orders, Professor? Can I send Mrs. Rubek anything? PROFESSOR RUBEK. No thank you; nothing for me. MAIA. Nor for me. [The INSPECTOR goes into the hotel. ULFHEIM. [Stares at them for a moment; then lifts his hat.] Why, blast me if here isn't a country tyke that has strayed into regular tip-top society. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Looking up.] What do you mean by that, Mr. Ulfheim? ULFHEIM. [More quietly and politely.] I believe I have the honour of addressing no less a person than the great Sculptor Rubek. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Nods.] I remember meeting you once or twice--the autumn when I was last at home. ULFHEIM. That's many years ago, now. And then you weren't so illustrious as I hear you've since become. At that time even a dirty bear-hunter might venture to come near you. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Smiling.] I don't bite even now. MAIA. [Looks with interest at ULFHEIM.] Are you really and truly a bear-hunter? ULFHEIM. [Seating himself at the next table, nearer the hotel.] A bear-hunter when I have the chance, madam. But I make the best of any sort of game that comes in my way--eagles, and wolves, and women, and elks, and reindeer--if only it's fresh and juicy and has plenty of blood in it. [Drinks from his pocket-flask. MAIA. [Regarding him fixedly.] But you like bear-hunting best? ULFHEIM. I like it best, yes. For then one can have the knife handy at a pinch. [With a slight smile.] We both work in a hard material, madam--both your husband and I. He struggles with his marble blocks, I daresay; and I struggle with tense and quivering bear-sinews. And we both of us win the fight in the end--subdue and master our material. We never rest till we've got the upper hand of it, though it fight never so hard. PROFESSOR RUBEK.
