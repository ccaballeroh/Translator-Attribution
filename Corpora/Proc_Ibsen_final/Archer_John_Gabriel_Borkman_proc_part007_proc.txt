 ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, I daresay her father can't afford to do much. MRS. BORKMAN. And then Erhart has arranged for her to have lessons in music. She has made such progress already that she can come up to--to him in the gallery, and play to him. ELLA RENTHEIM. So he is still fond of music? MRS. BORKMAN. Oh yes, I suppose he is. Of course he has the piano you sent out here--when he was expected back---- ELLA RENTHEIM. And she plays to him on it? MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, now and then--in the evenings. That is Erhart's doing, too. ELLA RENTHEIM. Has the poor girl to come all the long way out here, and then back to town again? MRS. BORKMAN. No, she doesn't need to. Erhart has arranged for her to stay with a lady who lives near us--a Mrs. Wilton---- ELLA RENTHEIM. [With interest.] Mrs. Wilton? MRS. BORKMAN. A very rich woman. You don't know her. ELLA RENTHEIM. I have heard her name. Mrs. Fanny Wilton, is it not----? MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, quite right. ELLA RENTHEIM. Erhart has mentioned her several times. Does she live out here now? MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, she has taken a villa here; she moved out from town some time ago. ELLA RENTHEIM. [With a slight hesitation.] They say she is divorced from her husband. MRS. BORKMAN. Her husband has been dead for several years. ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, but they were divorced. He got a divorce. MRS. BORKMAN. He deserted her, that is what he did. I am sure the fault wasn't hers. ELLA RENTHEIM. Do you know her at all intimately, Gunhild? MRS. BORKMAN. Oh yes, pretty well. She lives close by here; and she looks in every now and then. ELLA RENTHEIM. And do you like her? MRS. BORKMAN. She is unusually intelligent; remarkably clear in her judgments. ELLA RENTHEIM. In her judgments of people, do you mean? MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, principally of people. She has made quite a study of Erhart; looked deep into his character--into his soul. And the result is she idolises him, as she could not help doing. ELLA RENTHEIM. [With a touch of finesse.] Then perhaps she knows Erhart still better than she knows you? MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, Erhart saw a good deal of her in town, before she came out here. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Without thinking.] And in spite of that she moved out of town? MRS. BORKMAN. [Taken aback, looking keenly at her.] In spite of that! What do you mean? ELLA RENTHEIM. [Evasively.] Oh, nothing particular. MRS. BORKMAN. You said it strangely--you did mean something by it, Ella! ELLA RENTHEIM. [Looking her straight in the eyes.] Yes, that is true, Gunhild! I did mean something by it. MRS. BORKMAN. Well, then, say it right out. ELLA RENTHEIM. First let me tell you, I think I too have a certain claim upon Erhart. Do you think I haven't? MRS. BORKMAN. [Glancing round the room.] No doubt--after all the money you have spent upon him. ELLA RENTHEIM. Oh, not on that account, Gunhild. But because I love him. MRS. BORKMAN. [Smiling scornfully.] Love my son? Is it possible? You? In spite of everything? ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, it is possible--in spite of everything. And it is true. I love Erhart--as much as I can love any one--now--at my time of life. MRS. BORKMAN. Well, well, suppose you do: what then? ELLA RENTHEIM. Why, then, I am troubled as soon as I see anything threatening him. MRS. BORKMAN. Threatening Erhart! Why, what should threaten him? Or who? ELLA RENTHEIM. You in the first place--in your way. MRS. BORKMAN. [Vehemently.] I! ELLA RENTHEIM. And then this Mrs. Wilton, too, I am afraid. MRS. BORKMAN. [Looks at her for a moment in speechless surprise.] And you think such things of Erhart! Of my own boy! He, who has his great mission to fulfil! ELLA RENTHEIM. [Lightly.] Oh, his mission! MRS. BORKMAN. [Indignantly.] How dare you say that so scornfully? ELLA RENTHEIM. Do you think a young man of Erhart's age, full of health and spirits--do you think he is going to sacrifice himself for--for such a thing as a "mission"? MRS. BORKMAN. [Firmly and emphatically.] Erhart will! I know he will. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Shaking her head.] You neither know it nor believe it, Gunhild. MRS. BORKMAN. I don't believe it! ELLA RENTHEIM. It is only a dream that you cherish. For if you hadn't that to cling to, you feel that you would utterly despair. MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, indeed I should despair. [Vehemently.] And I daresay that is what you would like to see, Ella! ELLA RENTHEIM. [With head erect.] Yes, I would rather see that than see you "redeem" yourself at Erhart's expense. MRS. BORKMAN. [Threateningly.] You want to come between us? Between mother and son? You? ELLA RENTHEIM. I want to free him from your power--your will--your despotism. MRS. BORKMAN. [Triumphantly.] You are too late! You had him in your nets all these years--until he was fifteen. But now I have won him again, you see! ELLA RENTHEIM. Then I will win him back from you! [Hoarsely, half whispering.]
