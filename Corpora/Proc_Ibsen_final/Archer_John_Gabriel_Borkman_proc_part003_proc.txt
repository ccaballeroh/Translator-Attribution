and in one place "rehabilitation." The reader may bear in mind that these three terms represent one idea in the original. Borkman in Act II. uses a very odd expression--"overskurkens moral," which I have rendered "the morals of the higher rascality." I cannot but suspect (though for this I have no authority) that in the word "overskurk," which might be represented in German by "Ueberschurke," Borkman is parodying the expression "Uebermensch," of which so much has been heard of late. When I once suggested this to Ibsen, he neither affirmed nor denied it. I understood him to say, however, that in speaking of "overskurken" he had a particular man in view. Somewhat pusillanimously, perhaps, I pursued my inquiries no further. *Copyright, 1907, by Charles Scribner's Sons. JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN PERSONS. JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN, formerly Managing Director of a Bank. MRS. GUNHILD BORKMAN, his wife. ERHART BORKMAN, their son, a student. MISS ELLA RENTHEIM, Mrs. Borkman's twin sister. MRS. FANNY WILTON.

The action passes one winter evening, at the Manorhouse of the Rentheim family, in the neighbourhood of Christiania. JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN PLAY IN FOUR ACTS ACT FIRST MRS. BORKMAN's drawing-room, furnished with old-fashioned, faded splendour. At the back, an open sliding-door leads into a garden-room, with windows and a glass door. Through it a view over the garden; twilight with driving snow. On the right, a door leading from the hall. Further forward, a large old-fashioned iron stove, with the fire lighted. On the left, towards the back, a single smaller door. In front, on the same side, a window, covered with thick curtains. Between the window and the door a horsehair sofa, with a table in front of it covered with a cloth. On the table, a lighted lamp with a shade. Beside the stove a high-backed armchair. MRS. GUNHILD BORKMAN sits on the sofa, crocheting. She is an elderly lady, of cold, distinguished appearance, with stiff carriage and immobile features. Her abundant hair is very grey. Delicate transparent hands. Dressed in a gown of heavy dark silk, which has originally been handsome, but is now somewhat worn and shabby. A woollen shawl over her shoulders. She sits for a time erect and immovable at her crochet. Then the bells of a passing sledge are heard. MRS. BORKMAN. [Listens; her eyes sparkle with gladness and she involuntarily whispers]. Erhart! At last! [She rises and draws the curtain a little aside to look out. Appears disappointed, and sits down to her work again, on the sofa. Presently THE MAID enters from the hall with a visiting card on a small tray. MRS. BORKMAN. [Quickly.] Has Mr. Erhart come after all? THE MAID. No, ma'am. But there's a lady---- MRS. BORKMAN. [Laying aside her crochet.] Oh, Mrs. Wilton, I suppose---- THE MAID. [Approaching.] No, it's a strange lady---- MRS. BORKMAN. [Taking the card.] Let me see---- [Reads it; rises hastily and looks intently at the girl.] Are you sure this is for me? THE MAID. Yes, I understand it was for you, ma'am. MRS. BORKMAN. Did she say she wanted to see Mrs. Borkman? THE MAID. Yes, she did. MRS. BORKMAN. [Shortly, resolutely.] Good. Then say I am at home. [THE MAID opens the door for the strange lady and goes out. MISS ELLA RENTHEIM enters. She resembles her sister; but her face has rather a suffering than a hard expression. It still shows signs of great beauty, combined with strong character. She has a great deal of hair, which is drawn back from the forehead in natural ripples, and is snow-white. She is dressed in black velvet, with a hat and a fur-lined cloak of the same material. [The two sisters stand silent for a time, and look searchingly at each other. Each is evidently waiting for the other to speak first. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Who has remained near the door.] You are surprised to see me, Gunhild. MRS. BORKMAN. [Standing erect and immovable between the sofa and the table, resting her finger-tips upon the cloth.] Have you not made a mistake? The bailiff lives in the side wing, you know. ELLA RENTHEIM. It is not the bailiff I want to see to-day. MRS. BORKMAN. Is it me you want, then? ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes. I have a few words to say to you. MRS. BORKMAN. [Coming forward into the middle of the room.] Well--then sit down. ELLA RENTHEIM. Thank you. I can quite well stand for the present. MRS. BORKMAN. Just as you please. But at least loosen your cloak. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Unbuttoning her cloak.] Yes, it is very warm here. MRS. BORKMAN. I am always cold. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Stands looking at her for a time with her arms resting on the back of the armchair.] Well, Gunhild, it is nearly eight years
