 REGINA. [Looking hard at him.] What are you going to fool Pastor Manders into doing, this time? ENGSTRAND. Sh! sh! Are you crazy? Do _I_ want to fool Pastor Manders? Oh no! Pastor Manders has been far too good a friend to me for that. But I just wanted to say, you know--that I mean to be off home again to-night. REGINA. The sooner the better, say I. ENGSTRAND. Yes, but I want you with me, Regina. REGINA. [Open-mouthed.] You want me--? What are you talking about? ENGSTRAND. I want you to come home with me, I say. REGINA. [Scornfully.] Never in this world shall you get me home with you. ENGSTRAND. Oh, we'll see about that. REGINA. Yes, you may be sure we'll see about it! Me, that have been brought up by a lady like Mrs. Alving! Me, that am treated almost as a daughter here! Is it me you want to go home with you?--to a house like yours? For shame! ENGSTRAND. What the devil do you mean? Do you set yourself up against your father, you hussy? REGINA. [Mutters without looking at him.] You've said often enough I was no concern of yours. ENGSTRAND. Pooh! Why should you bother about that-- REGINA. Haven't you many a time sworn at me and called me a--? _Fi donc_! ENGSTRAND. Curse me, now, if ever I used such an ugly word. REGINA. Oh, I remember very well what word you used. ENGSTRAND. Well, but that was only when I was a bit on, don't you know? Temptations are manifold in this world, Regina. REGINA. Ugh! ENGSTRAND. And besides, it was when your mother was that aggravating--I had to find something to twit her with, my child. She was always setting up for a fine lady. [Mimics.] "Let me go, Engstrand; let me be. Remember I was three years in Chamberlain Alving's family at Rosenvold." [Laughs.] Mercy on us! She could never forget that the Captain was made a Chamberlain while she was in service here. REGINA. Poor mother! you very soon tormented her into her grave. ENGSTRAND. [With a twist of his shoulders.] Oh, of course! I'm to have the blame for everything. REGINA. [Turns away; half aloud.] Ugh--! And that leg too! ENGSTRAND. What do you say, my child? REGINA. _Pied de mouton_. ENGSTRAND. Is that English, eh? REGINA. Yes. ENGSTRAND. Ay, ay; you've picked up some learning out here; and that may come in useful now, Regina. REGINA. [After a short silence.] What do you want with me in town? ENGSTRAND. Can you ask what a father wants with his only child? A'n't I a lonely, forlorn widower? REGINA. Oh, don't try on any nonsense like that with me! Why do you want me? ENGSTRAND. Well, let me tell you, I've been thinking of setting up in a new line of business. REGINA. [Contemptuously.] You've tried that often enough, and much good you've done with it. ENGSTRAND. Yes, but this time you shall see, Regina! Devil take me-- REGINA. [Stamps.] Stop your swearing! ENGSTRAND. Hush, hush; you're right enough there, my girl. What I wanted to say was just this--I've laid by a very tidy pile from this Orphanage job. REGINA. Have you? That's a good thing for you. ENGSTRAND. What can a man spend his ha'pence on here in this country hole? REGINA. Well, what then? ENGSTRAND. Why, you see, I thought of putting the money into some paying speculation. I thought of a sort of a sailor's tavern-- REGINA. Pah! ENGSTRAND. A regular high-class affair, of course; not any sort of pig-sty for common sailors. No! damn it! it would be for captains and mates, and--and--regular swells, you know. REGINA. And I was to--? ENGSTRAND. You were to help, to be sure. Only for the look of the thing, you understand. Devil a bit of hard work shall you have, my girl. You shall do exactly what you like. REGINA. Oh, indeed! ENGSTRAND. But there must be a petticoat in the house; that's as clear as daylight. For I want to have it a bit lively like in the evenings, with singing and dancing, and so on. You must remember they're weary wanderers on the ocean of life. [Nearer.] Now don't be a fool and stand in your own light, Regina. What's to become of you out here? Your mistress has given you a lot of learning; but what good is that to you? You're to look after the children at the new Orphanage, I hear. Is that the sort of thing for you, eh? Are you so dead set on wearing your life out for a pack of dirty brats? REGINA. No; if things go as I want them to--Well there's no saying--there's no saying. ENGSTRAND. What do you mean by "there's no saying"? REGINA. Never you mind.--How much money have you saved? ENGSTRAND. What with one thing and another, a matter of seven or eight hundred crowns. [A "krone" is equal to one shilling and three-halfpence.] REGINA. That's not so bad. ENGSTRAND. It's enough to make a start with, my girl. REGINA. Aren't you thinking of giving me any? ENGSTRAND. No, I'm blest if I am! REGINA. Not even of sending me a scrap of stuff for a new dress? ENGSTRAND. Come to town with me, my lass, and you'll soon get dresses enough. REGINA. Pooh! I can do that on my own account, if I want to. ENGSTRAND. No, a father's guiding hand is what you want, Regina. Now,
