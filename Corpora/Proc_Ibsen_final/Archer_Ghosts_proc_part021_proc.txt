you enough. [REGINA brings the lamp and sets it upon the table.] MRS. ALVING. Regina, you may bring us a small bottle of champagne. REGINA. Very well, ma'am. [Goes out.] OSWALD. [Puts his arm round MRS. ALVING's neck.] That's just what I wanted. I knew mother wouldn't let her boy go thirsty. MRS. ALVING. My own, poor, darling Oswald; how could I deny you anything now? OSWALD. [Eagerly.] Is that true, mother? Do you mean it? MRS. ALVING. How? What? OSWALD. That you couldn't deny me anything. MRS. ALVING. My dear Oswald-- OSWALD. Hush! REGINA. [Brings a tray with a half-bottle of champagne and two glasses, which she sets on the table.] Shall I open it? OSWALD. No, thanks. I will do it myself. [REGINA goes out again.] MRS. ALVING. [Sits down by the table.] What was it you meant--that I mustn't deny you? OSWALD. [Busy opening the bottle.] First let us have a glass--or two. [The cork pops; he pours wine into one glass, and is about to pour it into the other.] MRS. ALVING. [Holding her hand over it.] Thanks; not for me. OSWALD. Oh! won't you? Then I will! [He empties the glass, fills, and empties it again; then he sits down by the table.] MRS. ALVING. [In expectancy.] Well? OSWALD. [Without looking at her.] Tell me--I thought you and Pastor Manders seemed so odd--so quiet--at dinner to-day. MRS. ALVING. Did you notice it? OSWALD. Yes. H'm--[After a short silence.] Tell me: what do you think of Regina? MRS. ALVING. What do I think? OSWALD. Yes; isn't she splendid? MRS. ALVING. My dear Oswald, you don't know her as I do-- OSWALD. Well? MRS. ALVING. Regina, unfortunately, was allowed to stay at home too long. I ought to have taken her earlier into my house. OSWALD. Yes, but isn't she splendid to look at, mother? [He fills his glass.] MRS. ALVING. Regina has many serious faults-- OSWALD. Oh, what does that matter? [He drinks again.] MRS. ALVING. But I am fond of her, nevertheless, and I am responsible for her. I wouldn't for all the world have any harm happen to her. OSWALD. [Springs up.] Mother, Regina is my only salvation! MRS. ALVING. [Rising.] What do you mean by that? OSWALD. I cannot go on bearing all this anguish of soul alone. MRS. ALVING. Have you not your mother to share it with you? OSWALD. Yes; that's what I thought; and so I came home to you. But that will not do. I see it won't do. I cannot endure my life here. MRS. ALVING. Oswald! OSWALD. I must live differently, mother. That is why I must leave you. I will not have you looking on at it. MRS. ALVING. My unhappy boy! But, Oswald, while you are so ill as this-- OSWALD. If it were only the illness, I should stay with you, mother, you may be sure; for you are the best friend I have in the world. MRS. ALVING. Yes, indeed I am, Oswald; am I not? OSWALD. [Wanders restlessly about.] But it's all the torment, the gnawing remorse--and then, the great, killing dread. Oh--that awful dread! MRS. ALVING. [Walking after him.] Dread? What dread? What do you mean? OSWALD. Oh, you mustn't ask me any more. I don't know. I can't describe it. MRS. ALVING. [Goes over to the right and pulls the bell.] OSWALD. What is it you want? MRS. ALVING. I want my boy to be happy--that is what I want. He sha'n't go on brooding over things. [To REGINA, who appears at the door:] More champagne--a large bottle. [REGINA goes.] OSWALD. Mother! MRS. ALVING. Do you think we don't know how to live here at home? OSWALD. Isn't she splendid to look at? How beautifully she's built! And so thoroughly healthy! MRS. ALVING. [Sits by the table.] Sit down, Oswald; let us talk quietly together. OSWALD. [Sits.] I daresay you don't know, mother, that I owe Regina some reparation. MRS. ALVING. You! OSWALD. For a bit of thoughtlessness, or whatever you like to call it--very innocent, at any rate. When I was home last time-- MRS. ALVING. Well? OSWALD. She used often to ask me about Paris, and I used to tell her one thing and another. Then I recollect I happened to say to her one day, "Shouldn't you like to go there yourself?" MRS. ALVING. Well? OSWALD. I saw her face flush, and then she said, "Yes, I should like it of all things." "Ah, well," I replied, "it might perhaps be managed"--or something like that. MRS. ALVING. And then? OSWALD. Of course I had forgotten all about it; but the day before yesterday I happened to ask her whether she was glad I was to stay at home so long-- MRS. ALVING. Yes? OSWALD. And then she gave me such a strange look, and asked, "But what's to become of my trip to Paris?" MRS. ALVING. Her trip! OSWALD. And so it came out that she had taken the thing seriously; that she had been thinking of me the whole time, and had set to work to learn French-- MRS. ALVING. So that was why--! OSWALD. Mother--when I saw that fresh, lovely, splendid girl standing there before me--till then I had hardly noticed her--but when she stood there as though with open arms ready to receive me-- MRS. ALVING. Oswald! OSWALD.--then it flashed upon me that in her lay my salvation; for I saw
