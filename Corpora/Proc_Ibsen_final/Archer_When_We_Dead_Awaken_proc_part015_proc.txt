 [In a little while PROFESSOR RUBEK comes down to IRENE, but stops with the brook between them. IRENE. [After a short pause.] She--the other one--said that you had been waiting for me. PROFESSOR RUBEK. I have waited for you year after year--without myself knowing it. IRENE. I could not come to you, Arnold. I was lying down there, sleeping the long, deep, dreamful sleep. PROFESSOR RUBEK. But now you have awakened, Irene! IRENE. [Shakes her head.] I have the heavy, deep sleep still in my eyes. PROFESSOR RUBEK. You shall see that day will dawn and lighten for us both. IRENE. Do not believe that. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Urgently.] I do believe it! And I know it! Now that I have found you again-- IRENE. Risen from the grave. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Transfigured! IRENE. Only risen, Arnold. Not transfigured. [He crosses over to her by means of stepping-stones below the cascade. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Where have you been all day, Irene? IRENE. [Pointing.] Far, far over there, on the great dead waste-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Turning the conversation.] You have not your--your friend with you to-day, I see. IRENE. [Smiling.] My friend is keeping a close watch on me, none the less. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Can she? IRENE. [Glancing furtively around.] You may be sure she can--wherever I may go. She never loses sight of me-- [Whispering.] Until, one fine sunny morning, I shall kill her. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Would you do that? IRENE. With the utmost delight--if only I could manage it. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Why do you want to? IRENE. Because she deals in witchcraft. [Mysteriously.] Only think, Arnold--she has changed herself into my shadow. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Trying to calm her.] Well, well, well--a shadow we must all have. IRENE. I am my own shadow. [With an outburst.] Do you not understand that! PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Sadly.] Yes, yes, Irene, I understand. [He seats himself on a stone beside the brook. She stands behind him, leaning against the wall of rock. IRENE. [After a pause.] Why do you sit there turning your eyes away from me? PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Softly, shaking his head.] I dare not--I dare not look at you. IRENE. Why dare you not look at me any more? PROFESSOR RUBEK. You have a shadow that tortures me. And I have the crushing weight of my conscience. IRENE. [With a glad cry of deliverance.] At last! PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Springs up.] Irene--what is it! IRENE. [Motioning him off.] Keep still, still, still! [Draws a deep breath and says, as though relieved of a burden.] There! Now they let me go. For this time.--Now we can sit down and talk as we used to--when I was alive. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Oh, if only we could talk as we used to. IRENE. Sit there, where you were sitting. I will sit here beside you. [He sits down again. She seats herself on another stone, close to him. IRENE. [After a short interval of silence.] Now I have come back to you from the uttermost regions, Arnold. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Aye, truly, from an endless journey. IRENE. Come home to my lord and master-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. To our home;--to our own home, Irene. IRENE. Have you looked for my coming every single day? PROFESSOR RUBEK. How dared I look for you? IRENE. [With a sidelong glance.] No, I suppose you dared not. For you understood nothing. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Was it really not for the sake of some one else that you all of a sudden disappeared from me in that way? IRENE. Might it not quite well be for your sake, Arnold? PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Looks doubtfully at her.] I don't understand you--? IRENE. When I had served you with my soul and with my body--when the statue stood there finished--our child as you called it--then I laid at your feet the most precious sacrifice of all--by effacing myself for all time. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Bows his head.] And laying my life waste. IRENE. [Suddenly firing up.] It was just that I wanted! Never, never should you create anything again--after you had created that only child of ours. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Was it jealously that moved you, then? IRENE. [Coldly.] I think it was rather hatred. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Hatred? Hatred for me? IRENE. [Again vehemently.] Yes, for you--for the artist who had so lightly and carelessly taken a warm-blooded body, a young human life, and worn the soul out of it--because you needed it for a work of art. PROFESSOR RUBEK. And you can say that--you who threw yourself into my work with such saint-like passion and such ardent joy?--that work for which we two met together every morning, as for an act of worship. IRENE. [Coldly, as before.] I will tell you one thing, Arnold. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Well? IRENE. I never loved your art, before I met you.--Nor after either. PROFESSOR RUBEK. But the artist, Irene? IRENE. The artist I hate. PROFESSOR RUBEK. The artist in me too? IRENE. In you most of all. When I unclothed myself and stood for you, then I
