Can you guess who it was from? BORKMAN. Possibly from your little Frida? FOLDAL. Precisely! Think of your hitting on it at once! Yes, it was a long letter from Frida. A footman had brought it. And can you imagine what was in it? BORKMAN. Perhaps it was to say good-bye to her mother and you? FOLDAL. Exactly! How good you are at guessing, John Gabriel! Yes, she tells me that Mrs. Wilton has taken such a fancy to her, and she is to go abroad with her and study music. And Mrs. Wilton has engaged a first-rate teacher who is to accompany them on the journey--and to read with Frida. For unfortunately she has been a good deal neglected in some branches, you see. BORKMAN. [Shaken with inward laughter.] Of course, of course--I see it all quite clearly, Vilhelm. FOLDAL. [Eagerly continuing.] And only think, she knew nothing about the arrangement until this evening; at that party, you know, h'm! And yet she found time to write to me. And the letter is such a beautiful one--so warm and affectionate, I assure you. There is not a trace of contempt for her father in it. And then what a delicate thought it was to say good-bye to us by letter--before she started. [Laughing.] But of course I can't let her go like that. BORKMAN. [Looks inquiringly at him.] How so? FOLDAL. She tells me that they start early to-morrow morning; quite early. BORKMAN. Oh indeed--to-morrow? Does she tell you that? FOLDAL. [Laughing and rubbing his hands.] Yes; but I know a trick worth two of that, you see! I am going straight up to Mrs. Wilton's---- BORKMAN. This evening? FOLDAL. Oh, it's not so very late yet. And even if the house is shut up, I shall ring; without hesitation. For I must and will see Frida before she starts. Good-night, good-night! [Makes a movement to go. BORKMAN. Stop a moment, my poor Vilhelm; you may spare yourself that heavy bit of road. FOLDAL. Oh, you are thinking of my ankle---- BORKMAN. Yes; and in any case you won't get in at Mrs. Wilton's. FOLDAL. Yes, indeed I will. I'll go on ringing and knocking till some one comes and lets me in. For I must and will see Frida. ELLA RENTHEIM. Your daughter has gone already, Mr. Foldal. FOLDAL. [Stands as though thunderstruck.] Has Frida gone already! Are you quite sure? Who told you? BORKMAN. We had it from her future teacher. FOLDAL. Indeed? And who is he? BORKMAN. A certain Mr. Erhart Borkman. FOLDAL. [Beaming with joy.] Your son, John Gabriel? Is he going with them? BORKMAN. Yes; it is he that is to help Mrs. Wilton with little Frida's education. FOLDAL. Oh, Heaven be praised! Then the child is in the best of hands. But is it quite certain that they have started with her already? BORKMAN. They took her away in that sledge which ran you over in the road. FOLDAL. [Clasping his hands.] To think that my little Frida was in that magnificent sledge! BORKMAN. [Nodding.] Yes, yes, Vilhelm, your daughter has come to drive in her carriage. And Master Erhart, too. Tell me, did you notice the silver bells? FOLDAL. Yes, indeed. Silver bells did you say? Were they silver? Real, genuine silver bells? BORKMAN. You may be quite sure of that. Everything was genuine--both outside and in. FOLDAL. [In quiet emotion.] Isn't it strange how fortune can sometimes befriend one? It is my--my little gift of song that has transmuted itself into music in Frida. So after all, it is not for nothing that I was born a poet. For now she is going forth into the great wide world, that I once yearned so passionately to see. Little Frida sets out in a splendid covered sledge with silver bells on the harness---- BORKMAN. And runs over her father. FOLDAL. [Happily.] Oh, pooh! What does it matter about me, if only the child----! Well, so I am too late, then, after all. I must go home again and comfort her mother. I left her crying in the kitchen. BORKMAN. Crying? FOLDAL. [Smiling.] Yes, would you believe it, she was crying her eyes out when I came away. BORKMAN. And you are laughing, Vilhelm? FOLDAL. Yes, _I_ am, of course. But she, poor thing, she doesn't know any better, you see. Well, good-bye! It's a good thing I have the tramway so handy. Good-bye, good-bye, John Gabriel. Good-bye, Madam. [He bows and limps laboriously out by the way he came. BORKMAN. [Stands silent for a moment, gazing before him.] Good-bye, Vilhelm! It is not the first time in your life that you've been run over, old friend. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Looking at him with suppressed anxiety.] You are so pale, John, so very pale. BORKMAN. That is the effect of the prison air up yonder. ELLA RENTHEIM. I have never seen you like this before. BORKMAN. No, for I suppose you have never seen an escaped convict before. ELLA RENTHEIM. Oh, do come into the house with me, John! BORKMAN. It is no use trying to lure me in. I have told you---- ELLA RENTHEIM. But when I beg and implore you----? For your own sake----
