himself to do such a thing? Hovstad. Ah, you must ask him that. Petra. I should never have thought it of him. Hovstad (looking more closely at her). No? Does it really surprise you so much? Petra. Yes. Or perhaps not altogether. Really, I don't quite know Hovstad. We journalists are not much worth, Miss Stockmann. Petra. Do you really mean that? Hovstad. I think so sometimes. Petra. Yes, in the ordinary affairs of everyday life, perhaps; I can understand that. But now, when you have taken a weighty matter in hand-- Hovstad. This matter of your father's, you mean? Petra. Exactly. It seems to me that now you must feel you are a man worth more than most. Hovstad. Yes, today I do feel something of that sort. Petra. Of course you do, don't you? It is a splendid vocation you have chosen--to smooth the way for the march of unappreciated truths, and new and courageous lines of thought. If it were nothing more than because you stand fearlessly in the open and take up the cause of an injured man-- Hovstad. Especially when that injured man is--ahem!--I don't rightly know how to-- Petra. When that man is so upright and so honest, you mean? Hovstad (more gently). Especially when he is your father I meant. Petra (suddenly checked). That? Hovstad. Yes, Petra--Miss Petra. Petra. Is it that, that is first and foremost with you? Not the matter itself? Not the truth?--not my father's big generous heart? Hovstad. Certainly--of course--that too. Petra. No, thank you; you have betrayed yourself, Mr. Hovstad, and now I shall never trust you again in anything. Hovstad. Can you really take it so amiss in me that it is mostly for your sake--? Petra. What I am angry with you for, is for not having been honest with my father. You talked to him as if the truth and the good of the community were what lay nearest to your heart. You have made fools of both my father and me. You are not the man you made yourself out to be. And that I shall never forgive you-never! Hovstad. You ought not to speak so bitterly, Miss Petra--least of all now. Petra. Why not now, especially? Hovstad. Because your father cannot do without my help. Petra (looking him up and down). Are you that sort of man too? For shame! Hovstad. No, no, I am not. This came upon me so unexpectedly--you must believe that. Petra. I know what to believe. Goodbye. Aslaksen (coming from the printing room, hurriedly and with an air of mystery). Damnation, Hovstad!--(Sees PETRA.) Oh, this is awkward-- Petra. There is the book; you must give it to some one else. (Goes towards the door.) Hovstad (following her). But, Miss Stockmann-- Petra. Goodbye. (Goes out.) Aslaksen. I say--Mr. Hovstad-- Hovstad. Well well!--what is it? Aslaksen. The Mayor is outside in the printing room. Hovstad. The Mayor, did you say? Aslaksen. Yes he wants to speak to you. He came in by the back door--didn't want to be seen, you understand. Hovstad. What can he want? Wait a bit--I will go myself. (Goes to the door of the printing room, opens it, bows and invites PETER STOCKMANN in.) Just see, Aslaksen, that no one-- Aslaksen. Quite so. (Goes into the printing-room.) Peter Stockmann. You did not expect to see me here, Mr. Hovstad? Hovstad. No, I confess I did not. Peter Stockmann (looking round). You are very snug in here--very nice indeed. Hovstad. Oh-- Peter Stockmann. And here I come, without any notice, to take up your time! Hovstad. By all means, Mr. Mayor. I am at your service. But let me relieve you of your--(takes STOCKMANN's hat and stick and puts them on a chair). Won't you sit down? Peter Stockmann (sitting down by the table). Thank you. (HOVSTAD sits down.) I have had an extremely annoying experience to-day, Mr. Hovstad. Hovstad. Really? Ah well, I expect with all the various business you have to attend to-- Peter Stockmann. The Medical Officer of the Baths is responsible for what happened today. Hovstad. Indeed? The Doctor? Peter Stockmann. He has addressed a kind of report to the Baths Committee on the subject of certain supposed defects in the Baths. Hovstad. Has he indeed? Peter Stockmann. Yes--has he not told you? I thought he said-- Hovstad. Ah, yes--it is true he did mention something about-- Aslaksen (coming from the printing-room). I ought to have that copy. Hovstad (angrily). Ahem!--there it is on the desk. Aslaksen (taking it). Right. Peter Stockmann. But look there--that is the thing I was speaking of! Aslaksen. Yes, that is the Doctor's article, Mr. Mayor. Hovstad. Oh, is THAT what you were speaking about? Peter Stockmann. Yes, that is it. What do you think of it? Hovstad. Oh, I am only a layman--and I have only taken a very cursory glance at it. Peter Stockmann. But you are going to print it? Hovstad. I cannot very well refuse a distinguished man. Aslaksen. I have nothing to do with editing the paper, Mr. Mayor-- Peter Stockmann. I understand. Aslaksen. I merely print what is put into my hands. Peter Stockmann. Quite so. Aslaksen. And so I must-- (moves off towards the printing-room).
