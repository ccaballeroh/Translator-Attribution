that a certain married woman, whose husband had deserted her, had a child by him? Rebecca. I have heard it; but of course that was long before I came here. Mrs. Helseth. Bless me, yes--he was quite a young man then. But she might have had more sense than he had. He wanted to marry her, too, but that could not be done; and so he had to pay heavily for it. But since then--my word!--Mortensgaard has risen in the world. There are lots of people who run after him now. Rebecca. I believe most of the poor people turn to him first when they are in any trouble. Mrs. Helseth. Oh, not only the poor people, miss-- Rebecca (glancing at her unobserved). Indeed? Mrs. Helseth (standing at the sofa, dusting vigorously). People you would least expect, sometimes, miss. Rebecca (arranging the flowers). Yes, but that is only an idea of yours, Mrs. Helseth. You cannot know that for certain. Mrs. Helseth. You think I don't know anything about that for certain, do you, miss? Indeed I do. Because--if I must let out the secret at last--I carried a letter to Mortensgaard myself once. Rebecca (turns round). No--did you! Mrs. Helseth. Yes, that I did. And that letter, let me tell you, was written here--at Rosmersholm. Rebecca. Really, Mrs. Helseth? Mrs. Helseth. I give you my word it was, miss. And it was written on good note-paper--and sealed with beautiful red sealing-wax. Rebecca. And you were entrusted with the delivery of it? Dear Mrs. Helseth, it is not very difficult to guess whom it was from. Mrs. Helseth. Who, then? Rebecca. Naturally, it was something that poor Mrs. Rosmer in her invalid state-- Mrs. Helseth. Well, you have mentioned her name, miss--not I. Rebecca. But what was in the letter?--No, of course, you cannot know that. Mrs. Helseth. Hm!--it is just possible I may know, all the same. Rebecca. Did she tell you what she was writing about, then? Mrs. Helseth. No, she did not do that. But when Mortensgaard had read it, he set to work and cross-questioned me, so that I got a very good idea of what was in it. Rebecca. What do you think was in it, then? Oh, dear, good Mrs. Helseth, do tell me! Mrs. Helseth. Certainly not, miss. Not for worlds. Rebecca. Oh, you can tell me. You and I are such friends, you know. Mrs. Helseth. Heaven forbid I should tell you anything about that, miss. I shall not tell you anything, except that it was some dreadful idea that they had gone and put into my poor sick mistress's head. Rebecca. Who had put it into her head? Mrs. Helseth. Wicked people, miss. Wicked people. Rebecca. Wicked--? Mrs. Helseth. Yes, I say it again--very wicked people, they must have been. Rebecca. And what do you think it could be? Mrs. Helseth. Oh, I know what I think--but, please Heaven, I'll keep my mouth shut. At the same time, there is a certain lady in the town--hm! Rebecca. I can see you mean Mrs. Kroll. Mrs. Helseth. Yes, she is a queer one, she is. She has always been very much on the high horse with me. And she has never looked with any friendly eye on you, either, miss. Rebecca. Do you think Mrs. Rosmer was quite in her right mind when she wrote that letter to Mortensgaard? Mrs. Helseth. It is so difficult to tell, miss. I certainly don't think she was quite out of her mind. Rebecca. But you know she seemed to go quite distracted when she learnt that she would never be able to have a child. That was when her madness first showed itself. Mrs. Helseth. Yes, that had a terrible effect on her, poor lady. Rebecca (taking up her work, and sitting down on a chair by the window). But, in other respects, do you not think that was really a good thing for Mr. Rosmer, Mrs. Helseth? Mrs. Helseth. What, miss? Rebecca. That there were no children? Mrs. Helseth. Hm!--I really do not know what to say to that. Rebecca. Believe me, it was best for him. Mr. Rosmer was never meant to be surrounded by crying children. Mrs. Helseth. Little children do not cry at Rosmersholm, Miss West. Rebecca (looking at her). Not cry? Mrs. Helseth. No. In this house, little children have never been known to cry, as long as any one can remember. Rebecca. That is very strange. Mrs. Helseth. Yes, isn't it, miss? But it runs in the family. And there is another thing that is just as strange; when they grow up they never laugh--never laugh, all their lives. Rebecca. But that would be extraordinary Mrs. Helseth. Have you ever once heard or seen Mr. Rosmer laugh, miss? Rebecca. No--now that I think of it, I almost believe you are right. But I fancy most of the folk hereabouts laugh very little. Mrs. Helseth. That is quite true. People say it began at Rosmersholm, and I expect it spread like a sort of infection. Rebecca. You are a sagacious woman, Mrs. Helseth! Mrs. Helseth. Oh, you mustn't sit there and make game of me, miss. (Listens.) Hush, hush--Mr. Rosmer is coming down. He doesn't like to see brooms about. (Goes out by the door on the right. ROSMER, with his stick and hat in his hand, comes in from the lobby.)
