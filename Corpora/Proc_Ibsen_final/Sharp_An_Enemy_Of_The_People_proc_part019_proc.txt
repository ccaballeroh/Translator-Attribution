 Peter Stockmann. No, but wait a moment, Mr. Aslaksen. You will allow me, Mr. Hovstad? Hovstad. If you please, Mr. Mayor. Peter Stockmann. You are a discreet and thoughtful man, Mr. Aslaksen. Aslaksen. I am delighted to hear you think so, sir. Peter Stockmann. And a man of very considerable influence. Aslaksen. Chiefly among the small tradesmen, sir. Peter Stockmann. The small tax-payers are the majority--here as everywhere else. Aslaksen. That is true. Peter Stockmann. And I have no doubt you know the general trend of opinion among them, don't you? Aslaksen. Yes I think I may say I do, Mr. Mayor. Peter Stockmann. Yes. Well, since there is such a praiseworthy spirit of self-sacrifice among the less wealthy citizens of our town-- Aslaksen. What? Hovstad. Self-sacrifice? Peter Stockmann. It is pleasing evidence of a public-spirited feeling, extremely pleasing evidence. I might almost say I hardly expected it. But you have a closer knowledge of public opinion than I. Aslaksen. But, Mr. Mayor-- Peter Stockmann. And indeed it is no small sacrifice that the town is going to make. Hovstad. The town? Aslaksen. But I don't understand. Is it the Baths--? Peter Stockmann. At a provisional estimate, the alterations that the Medical Officer asserts to be desirable will cost somewhere about twenty thousand pounds. Aslaksen. That is a lot of money, but-- Peter Stockmann. Of course it will be necessary to raise a municipal loan. Hovstad (getting up). Surely you never mean that the town must pay--? Aslaksen. Do you mean that it must come out of the municipal funds?--out of the ill-filled pockets of the small tradesmen? Peter Stockmann. Well, my dear Mr. Aslaksen, where else is the money to come from? Aslaksen. The gentlemen who own the Baths ought to provide that. Peter Stockmann. The proprietors of the Baths are not in a position to incur any further expense. Aslaksen. Is that absolutely certain, Mr. Mayor? Peter Stockmann. I have satisfied myself that it is so. If the town wants these very extensive alterations, it will have to pay for them. Aslaksen. But, damn it all--I beg your pardon--this is quite another matter, Mr. Hovstad! Hovstad. It is, indeed. Peter Stockmann. The most fatal part of it is that we shall be obliged to shut the Baths for a couple of years. Hovstad. Shut them? Shut them altogether? Aslaksen. For two years? Peter Stockmann. Yes, the work will take as long as that--at least. Aslaksen. I'm damned if we will stand that, Mr. Mayor! What are we householders to live upon in the meantime? Peter Stockmann. Unfortunately, that is an extremely difficult question to answer, Mr. Aslaksen. But what would you have us do? Do you suppose we shall have a single visitor in the town, if we go about proclaiming that our water is polluted, that we are living over a plague spot, that the entire town-- Aslaksen. And the whole thing is merely imagination? Peter Stockmann. With the best will in the world, I have not been able to come to any other conclusion. Aslaksen. Well then I must say it is absolutely unjustifiable of Dr. Stockmann--I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor. Peter Stockmann. What you say is lamentably true, Mr. Aslaksen. My brother has unfortunately always been a headstrong man. Aslaksen. After this, do you mean to give him your support, Mr. Hovstad? Hovstad. Can you suppose for a moment that I--? Peter Stockmann. I have drawn up a short resume of the situation as it appears from a reasonable man's point of view. In it I have indicated how certain possible defects might suitably be remedied without outrunning the resources of the Baths Committee. Hovstad. Have you got it with you, Mr. Mayor? Peter Stockmann (fumbling in his pocket). Yes, I brought it with me in case you should-- Aslaksen. Good Lord, there he is! Peter Stockmann. Who? My brother? Hovstad. Where? Where? Aslaksen. He has just gone through the printing room. Peter Stockmann. How unlucky! I don't want to meet him here, and I had still several things to speak to you about. Hovstad (pointing to the door on the right). Go in there for the present. Peter Stockmann. But--? Hovstad. You will only find Billing in there. Aslaksen. Quick, quick, Mr. Mayor--he is just coming. Peter Stockmann. Yes, very well; but see that you get rid of him quickly. (Goes out through the door on the right, which ASLAKSEN opens for him and shuts after him.) Hovstad. Pretend to be doing something, Aslaksen. (Sits down and writes. ASLAKSEN begins foraging among a heap of newspapers that are lying on a chair.) Dr. Stockmann (coming in from the printing room). Here I am again. (Puts down his hat and stick.) Hovstad (writing). Already, Doctor? Hurry up with what we were speaking about, Aslaksen. We are very pressed for time today. Dr. Stockmann (to ASLAKSEN). No proof for me to see yet, I hear. Aslaksen (without turning round). You couldn't expect it yet, Doctor. Dr. Stockmann. No, no; but I am impatient, as you can understand. I
