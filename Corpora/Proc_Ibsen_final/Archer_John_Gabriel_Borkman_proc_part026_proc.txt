 MRS. BORKMAN. [With a gesture of repulsion.] Don't touch me! ERHART. [Gently.] Is that your last word? MRS. BORKMAN. [Sternly.] Yes. ERHART. [Turning.] Good-bye to you, then, Aunt Ella. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Pressing his hands.] Good-bye, Erhart! And live your life-- and be as happy--as happy as ever you can. ERHART. Thanks, Aunt. [Bowing to BORKMAN.] Good-bye, father. [Whispers to MRS. WILTON.] Let us get away, the sooner the better. MRS. WILTON. [In a low voice.] Yes, let us. MRS. BORKMAN. [With a malignant smile.] Mrs. Wilton, do you think you are acting quite wisely in taking that girl with you? MRS. WILTON. [Returning the smile, half ironically, half seriously.] Men are so unstable, Mrs. Borkman. And women too. When Erhart is done with me--and I with him--then it will be well for us both that he, poor fellow, should have some one to fall back upon. MRS. BORKMAN. But you yourself? MRS. WILTON. Oh, I shall know what to do, I assure you. Good-bye to you all! [She bows and goes out by the hall door. ERHART stands for a moment as though wavering; then he turns and follows her. MRS. BORKMAN. [Dropping her folded hands.] Childless. BORKMAN. [As though awakening to a resolution.] Then out into the storm alone! My hat! My cloak! [He goes hastily towards the door. ELLA RENTHEIM. [In terror, stopping him.] John Gabriel, where are you going? BORKMAN. Out into the storm of life, I tell you. Let me go, Ella! ELLA RENTHEIM. [Holding him back.] No, no, I won't let you out! You are ill. I can see it in your face! BORKMAN. Let me go, I tell you! [He tears himself away from her, and goes out by the hall. ELLA RENTHEIM. [In the doorway.] Help me to hold him, Gunhild! MRS. BORKMAN. [Coldly and sharply, standing in the middle of the room.] I will not try to hold any one in all the world. Let them go away from me--both the one and the other! As far--as far as ever they please. [Suddenly, with a piercing shriek.] Erhart, don't leave me! [She rushes with outstretched arms towards the door. ELLA RENTHEIM stops her. ACT FOURTH An open space outside the main building, which lies to the right. A projecting corner of it is visible, with a door approached by a flight of low stone steps. The background consists of steep fir-clad slopes, quite close at hand. On the left are small scattered trees, forming the margin of a wood. The snowstorm has ceased; but the newly fallen snow lies deep around. The fir-branches droop under heavy loads of snow. The night is dark, with drifting clouds. Now and then the moon gleams out faintly. Only a dim light is reflected from the snow. BORKMAN, MRS. BORKMAN and ELLA RENTHEIM are standing upon the steps, BORKMAN leaning wearily against the wall of the house. He has an old-fashioned cape thrown over his shoulders, holds a soft grey felt hat in one hand and a thick knotted stick in the other. ELLA RENTHEIM carries her cloak over her arm. MRS. BORKMAN's great shawl has slipped down over her shoulders, so that her hair is uncovered. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Barring the way for MRS. BORKMAN.] Don't go after him, Gunhild! MRS. BORKMAN. [In fear and agitation.] Let me pass, I say! He must not go away from me! ELLA RENTHEIM. It is utterly useless, I tell you! You will never overtake him. MRS. BORKMAN. Let me go, Ella! I will cry aloud after him all down the road. And he must hear his mother's cry! ELLA RENTHEIM. He cannot hear you. You may be sure he is in the sledge already. MRS. BORKMAN. No, no; he can't be in the sledge yet! ELLA RENTHEIM. The doors are closed upon him long ago, believe me. MRS. BORKMAN. [In despair.] If he is in the sledge, then he is there with her, with her--her! BORKMAN. [Laughing gloomily.] Then he probably won't hear his mother's cry. MRS. BORKMAN. No, he will not hear it. [Listening.] Hark! what is that? ELLA RENTHEIM. [Also listening.] It sounds like sledge-bells. MRS. BORKMAN. [With a suppressed scream.] It is her sledge! ELLA RENTHEIM. Perhaps it's another. MRS. BORKMAN. No, no, it is Mrs. Wilton's covered sledge! I know the silver bells! Hark! Now they are driving right past here, at the foot of the hill! ELLA RENTHEIM. [Quickly.] Gunhild, if you want to cry out to him, now is the time! Perhaps after all----! [The tinkle of the bells sounds close at hand, in the wood.] Make haste, Gunhild! Now they are right under us! MRS. BORKMAN. [Stands for a moment undecided, then she stiffens and says sternly and coldly.] No. I will not cry out to him. Let Erhart Borkman pass away from me--far, far away--to what he calls life and happiness. [The sound dies away in the distance. ELLA RENTHEIM. [After a moment.] Now the bells are out of hearing. MRS. BORKMAN. They sounded like funeral bells. BORKMAN. [With a dry suppressed laugh.] Oho--it is not for me they are
