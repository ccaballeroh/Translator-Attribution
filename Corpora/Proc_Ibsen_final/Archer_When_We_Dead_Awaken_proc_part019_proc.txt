 I am free as a bird! I am free! For I believe I have awakened now--at last. PROFESSOR RUBEK. It almost seems so. MAIA. [Drawing a deep breath.] Oh--how divinely light one feels on waking! PROFESSOR RUBEK. Good-night, Frau Maia--and good luck to-- ULFHEIM. [Calls out, interposing.] Hush, hush!--for the devil's sake let's have none of your wizard wishes. Don't you see that we are going out to shoot-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. What will you bring me home from the hunting, Maia? MAIA. You shall have a bird of prey to model. I shall wing one for you. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Laughs mockingly and bitterly.] Yes, to wing things--without knowing what you are doing--that has long been quite in your way. MAIA. [Tossing her head.] Oh, just let me take care of myself for the future, and I wish you then--! [Nods and laughs roguishly.] Good-bye--and a good, peaceful summer night on the upland! PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Jestingly.] Thanks! And all the ill-luck in the world over you and your hunting! ULFHEIM. [Roaring with laughter.] There now, that is a wish worth having! MAIA. [Laughing.] Thanks, thanks, thanks, Professor! [They have both crossed the visible portion of the upland, and go out through the bushes to the right. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [After a short pause.] A summer night on the upland! Yes, that would have been life! IRENE. [Suddenly, with a wild expression in her eyes.] Will you spend a summer night on the upland--with me? PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Stretching his arms wide.] Yes, yes,--come! IRENE. My adored lord and master! PROFESSOR RUBEK. Oh, Irene! IRENE. [Hoarsely, smiling and groping in her breast.] It will be only an episode-- [Quickly, whispering.] Hush!--do not look round, Arnold! PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Also in a low voice.] What is it? IRENE. A face that is staring at me. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Turns involuntarily.] Where! [With a start.] Ah--! [The SISTER OF MERCY's head is partly visible among the bushes beside the descent to the left. Her eyes are immovably fixed on IRENE. IRENE. [Rises and says softly.] We must part then. No, you must remain sitting. Do you hear? You must not go with me. [Bends over him and whispers.] Till we meet again--to-night--on the upland. PROFESSOR RUBEK. And you will come, Irene? IRENE. Yes, surely I will come. Wait for me here. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Repeats dreamily.] Summer night on the upland. With you. With you. [His eyes meet hers.] Oh, Irene--that might have been our life.--And that we have forfeited--we two. IRENE. We see the irretrievable only when-- [Breaks off. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Looks inquiringly at her.] When--? IRENE. When we dead awaken. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Shakes his head mournfully.] What do we really see then? IRENE. We see that we have never lived. [She goes towards the slope and descends. [The SISTER OF MERCY makes way for her and follows her. PROFESSOR RUBEK remains sitting motionless beside the brook. MAIA. [Is heard singing triumphantly among the hills.] I am free! I am free! I am free! No more life in the prison for me! I am free as a bird! I am free! ACT THIRD. [A wild riven mountain-side, with sheer precipices at the back. Snow-clad peaks rise to the right, and lose themselves in drifting mists. To the left, on a stone-scree, stands an old, half-ruined hut. It is early morning. Dawn is breaking. The sun has not yet risen. [MAIA comes, flushed and irritated, down over the stone-scree on the left. ULFHEIM follows, half angry, half laughing, holding her fast by the sleeve. MAIA. [Trying to tear herself loose.] Let me go! Let me go, I say! ULFHEIM. Come, Come! are you going to bite now? You're as snappish as a wolf. MAIA. [Striking him over the hand.] Let me, I tell you? And be quiet! ULFHEIM. No, confound me if I will! MAIA. Then I will not go another step with you. Do you hear?--not a single step! ULFHEIM. Ho, ho! How can you get away from me, here, on the wild mountain-side? MAIA. I will jump over the precipice yonder, if need be-- ULFHEIM. And mangle and mash yourself up into dogs'-meat! A juicy morsel! [Lets go his hold.] As you please. Jump over the precipice if you want to. It's a dizzy drop. There's only one narrow footpath down it, and that's almost impassable. MAIA. [Dusts her skirt with her hand, and looks at him with angry eyes.] Well, you are a nice one to go hunting with! ULFHEIM. Say rather, sporting. MAIA. Oh! So you call this sport, do you? ULFHEIM. Yes, I venture to take that liberty. It is the sort of sport I like best of all. MAIA. [Tossing her head.] Well--I must say! [After a pause; looks searchingly at him.] Why did you let the dogs loose up there? ULFHEIM. [Blinking his eyes and smiling.] So that they too might do a little hunting on their own account, don't you see? MAIA. There's not a word of truth in that! It wasn't for the dogs' sake that
