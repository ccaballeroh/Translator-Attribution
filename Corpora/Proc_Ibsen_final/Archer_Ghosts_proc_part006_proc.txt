I've got my eye on a capital house in Little Harbour Street. They don't want much ready-money; and it could be a sort of a Sailors' Home, you know. REGINA. But I will not live with you! I have nothing whatever to do with you. Be off! ENGSTRAND. You wouldn't stop long with me, my girl. No such luck! If you knew how to play your cards, such a fine figure of a girl as you've grown in the last year or two-- REGINA. Well? ENGSTRAND. You'd soon get hold of some mate--or maybe even a captain-- REGINA. I won't marry any one of that sort. Sailors have no _savoir vivre_. ENGSTRAND. What's that they haven't got? REGINA. I know what sailors are, I tell you. They're not the sort of people to marry. ENGSTRAND. Then never mind about marrying them. You can make it pay all the same. [More confidentially.] He--the Englishman--the man with the yacht--he came down with three hundred dollars, he did; and she wasn't a bit handsomer than you. REGINA. [Making for him.] Out you go! ENGSTRAND. [Falling back.] Come, come! You're not going to hit me, I hope. REGINA. Yes, if you begin talking about mother I shall hit you. Get away with you, I say! [Drives him back towards the garden door.] And don't slam the doors. Young Mr. Alving-- ENGSTRAND. He's asleep; I know. You're mightily taken up about young Mr. Alving--[More softly.] Oho! you don't mean to say it's him as--? REGINA. Be off this minute! You're crazy, I tell you! No, not that way. There comes Pastor Manders. Down the kitchen stairs with you. ENGSTRAND. [Towards the right.] Yes, yes, I'm going. But just you talk to him as is coming there. He's the man to tell you what a child owes its father. For I am your father all the same, you know. I can prove it from the church register. [He goes out through the second door to the right, which REGINA has opened, and closes again after him. REGINA glances hastily at herself in the mirror, dusts herself with her pocket handkerchief; and settles her necktie; then she busies herself with the flowers.] [PASTOR MANDERS, wearing an overcoat, carrying an umbrella, and with a small travelling-bag on a strap over his shoulder, comes through the garden door into the conservatory.] MANDERS. Good-morning, Miss Engstrand. REGINA. [Turning round, surprised and pleased.] No, really! Good morning, Pastor Manders. Is the steamer in already? MANDERS. It is just in. [Enters the sitting-room.] Terrible weather we have been having lately. REGINA. [Follows him.] It's such blessed weather for the country, sir. MANDERS. No doubt; you are quite right. We townspeople give too little thought to that. [He begins to take off his overcoat.] REGINA. Oh, mayn't I help you?--There! Why, how wet it is? I'll just hang it up in the hall. And your umbrella, too--I'll open it and let it dry. [She goes out with the things through the second door on the right. PASTOR MANDERS takes off his travelling bag and lays it and his hat on a chair. Meanwhile REGINA comes in again.] MANDERS. Ah, it's a comfort to get safe under cover. I hope everything is going on well here? REGINA. Yes, thank you, sir. MANDERS. You have your hands full, I suppose, in preparation for to-morrow? REGINA. Yes, there's plenty to do, of course. MANDERS. And Mrs. Alving is at home, I trust? REGINA. Oh dear, yes. She's just upstairs, looking after the young master's chocolate. MANDERS. Yes, by-the-bye--I heard down at the pier that Oswald had arrived. REGINA. Yes, he came the day before yesterday. We didn't expect him before to-day. MANDERS. Quite strong and well, I hope? REGINA. Yes, thank you, quite; but dreadfully tired with the journey. He has made one rush right through from Paris--the whole way in one train, I believe. He's sleeping a little now, I think; so perhaps we'd better talk a little quietly. MANDERS. Sh!--as quietly as you please. REGINA. [Arranging an arm-chair beside the table.] Now, do sit down, Pastor Manders, and make yourself comfortable. [He sits down; she places a footstool under his feet.] There! Are you comfortable now, sir? MANDERS. Thanks, thanks, extremely so. [Looks at her.] Do you know, Miss Engstrand, I positively believe you have grown since I last saw you. REGINA. Do you think so, Sir? Mrs. Alving says I've filled out too. MANDERS. Filled out? Well, perhaps a little; just enough. [Short pause.] REGINA. Shall I tell Mrs. Alving you are here? MANDERS. Thanks, thanks, there is no hurry, my dear child.--By-the-bye, Regina, my good girl, tell me: how is your father getting on out here? REGINA. Oh, thank you, sir, he's getting on well enough. MANDERS. He called upon me last time he was in town. REGINA. Did he, indeed? He's always so glad of a chance of talking to you, sir. MANDERS. And you often look in upon him at his work, I daresay? REGINA. I? Oh, of course, when I have time, I-- MANDERS. Your father is not a man of strong character, Miss Engstrand. He stands terribly in need of a guiding hand. REGINA. Oh, yes; I daresay he does. MANDERS. He requires some one near him whom he cares for, and whose
