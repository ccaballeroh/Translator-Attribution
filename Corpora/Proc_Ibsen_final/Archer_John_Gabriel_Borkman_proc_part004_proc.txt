now since we saw each other last. MRS. BORKMAN. [Coldly.] Since last we spoke to each other at any rate. ELLA RENTHEIM. True, since we spoke to each other. I daresay you have seen me now and again--when I came on my yearly visit to the bailiff. MRS. BORKMAN. Once or twice, I have. ELLA RENTHEIM. I have caught one or two glimpses of you, too--there, at the window. MRS. BORKMAN. You must have seen me through the curtains then. You have good eyes. [Harshly and cuttingly.] But the last time we spoke to each other--it was here in this room---- ELLA RENTHEIM. [Trying to stop her.] Yes, yes; I know, Gunhild! MRS. BORKMAN. --the week before he--before he was let out. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Moving towards the back.] O, don't speak about that. MRS. BORKMAN. [Firmly, but in a low voice.] It was the week before he--was set at liberty. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Coming down.] Oh yes, yes, yes! I shall never forget that time! But it is too terrible to think of! Only to recall it for the moment--oh! MRS. BORKMAN. [Gloomily.] And yet one's thoughts can never get away from it. [Vehemently; clenching her hands together.] No, I can't understand how such a thing--how anything so horrible can come upon one single family! And then--that it should be our family! So old a family as ours! Think of its choosing us out! ELLA RENTHEIM. Oh, Gunhild--there were many, many families besides ours that that blow fell upon. MRS. BORKMAN. Oh yes; but those others don't trouble me very much. For in their case it was only a matter of a little money--or some papers. But for us----! For me! And then for Erhart! My little boy--as he then was! [In rising excitement.] The shame that fell upon us two innocent ones! The dishonour! The hateful, terrible dishonour! And then the utter ruin too! ELLA RENTHEIM. [Cautiously.] Tell me, Gunhild, how does he bear it? MRS. BORKMAN. Erhart, do you mean? ELLA RENTHEIM. No--he himself. How does he bear it? MRS. BORKMAN. [Scornfully.] Do you think I ever ask about that? ELLA RENTHEIM. Ask? Surely you do not require to ask---- MRS. BORKMAN. [Looks at her in surprise.] You don't suppose I ever have anything to do with him? That I ever meet him? That I see anything of him? ELLA RENTHEIM. Not even that! MRS. BORKMAN. [As before.] The man was in gaol, in gaol for five years! [Covers her face with her hands.] Oh, the crushing shame of it! [With increased vehemence.] And then to think of all that the name of John Gabriel Borkman used to mean! No, no, no--I can never see him again! Never! ELLA RENTHEIM. [Looks at her for a while.] You have a hard heart, Gunhild. MRS. BORKMAN. Towards him, yes. ELLA RENTHEIM. After all, he is your husband. MRS. BORKMAN. Did he not say in court that it was I who began his ruin? That I spent money so recklessly? ELLA RENTHEIM. [Tentatively.] But is there not some truth in that? MRS. BORKMAN. Why, it was he himself that made me do it! He insisted on our living in such an absurdly lavish style---- ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, I know. But that is just where you should have restrained him; and apparently you didn't. MRS. BORKMAN. How was I to know that it was not his own money he gave me to squander? And that he himself used to squander, too--ten times more than I did! ELLA RENTHEIM. [Quietly.] Well, I daresay his position forced him to do that-- to some extent at any rate. MRS. BORKMAN. [Scornfully.] Yes, it was always the same story--we were to "cut a figure." And he did "cut a figure" to some purpose! He used to drive about with a four-in-hand as if he were a king. And he had people bowing and scraping to him just as to a king. [With a laugh.] And they always called him by his Christian names--all the country over--as if he had been the king himself. "John Gabriel," "John Gabriel," "John Gabriel." Every one knew what a great man "John Gabriel" was! ELLA RENTHEIM. [Warmly and emphatically.] He was a great man then. MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, to all appearance. But he never breathed a single word to me as to his real position--never gave a hint as to where he got his means from. ELLA RENTHEIM. No, no; and other people did not dream of it either. MRS. BORKMAN. I don't care about the other people. But it was his duty to tell me the truth. And that he never did! He kept on lying to me--lying abominably---- ELLA RENTHEIM. [Interrupting.] Surely not, Gunhild. He kept things back perhaps, but I am sure he did not lie. MRS. BORKMAN. Well, well; call it what you please; it makes no difference. And then it all fell to pieces--the whole thing. ELLA RENTHEIM. [To herself.] Yes, everything fell to pieces--for him--and for others. MRS. BORKMAN. [Drawing herself up menacingly.] But I tell you this, Ella, I do not give in yet! I shall redeem myself yet--you may make up your mind to that! ELLA RENTHEIM. [Eagerly.] Redeem yourself! What do you mean by that? MRS. BORKMAN.
