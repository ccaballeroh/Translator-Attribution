 Redeem my name, and honour, and fortune! Redeem my ruined life-- that is what I mean! I have some one in reserve, let me tell you-- one who will wash away every stain that he has left. ELLA RENTHEIM. Gunhild! Gunhild! MRS. BORKMAN. [With rising excitement.] There is an avenger living, I tell you! One who will make up to me for all his father's sins! ELLA RENTHEIM. Erhart you mean. MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, Erhart, my own boy! He will redeem the family, the house, the name. All that can be redeemed.--And perhaps more besides. ELLA RENTHEIM. And how do you think that is to be done? MRS. BORKMAN. It must be done as best it can; I don't know how. But I know that it must and shall be done. [Looks searchingly at her.] Come now, Ella; isn't that really what you have had in mind too, ever since he was a child? ELLA RENTHEIM. No, I can't exactly say that. MRS. BORKMAN. No? Then why did you take charge of him when the storm broke upon--upon this house? ELLA RENTHEIM. You could not look after him yourself at that time, Gunhild. MRS. BORKMAN. No, no, I could not. And his father--he had a valid enough excuse--while he was there--in safe keeping---- ELLA RENTHEIM. [Indignant.] Oh, how can you say such things!--You! MRS. BORKMAN. [With a venomous expression.] And how could you make up your mind to take charge of the child of a--a John Gabriel! Just as if he had been your own? To take the child away from me--home with you--and keep him there year after year, until the boy was nearly grown up. [Looking suspiciously at her.] What was your real reason, Ella? Why did you keep him with you? ELLA RENTHEIM. I came to love him so dearly---- MRS. BORKMAN. More than I--his mother? ELLA RENTHEIM. [Evasively.] I don't know about that. And then, you know, Erhart was rather delicate as a child---- MRS. BORKMAN. Erhart--delicate! ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, I thought so--at that time at any rate. And you know the air of the west coast is so much milder than here. MRS. BORKMAN. [Smiling bitterly.] H'm--is it indeed? [Breaking off.] Yes, it is true you have done a great deal for Erhart. [With a change of tone.] Well, of course, you could afford it. [Smiling.] You were so lucky, Ella; you managed to save all your money. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Hurt.] I did not manage anything about it, I assure you. I had no idea--until long, long afterwards--that the securities belonging to me--that they had been left untouched. MRS. BORKMAN. Well, well; I don't understand anything about these things! I only say you were lucky. [Looking inquiringly at her.] But when you, of your own accord, undertook to educate Erhart for me--what was your motive in that? ELLA RENTHEIM. [Looking at her.] My motive? MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, some motive you must have had. What did you want to do with him? To make of him, I mean? ELLA RENTHEIM. [Slowly.] I wanted to smooth the way for Erhart to happiness in life. MRS. BORKMAN. [Contemptuously.] Pooh--people situated as we are have something else than happiness to think of. ELLA RENTHEIM. What, then? MRS. BORKMAN. [Looking steadily and earnestly at her.] Erhart has in the first place to make so brilliant a position for himself, that no trace shall be left of the shadow his father has cast upon my name--and my son's. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Searchingly.] Tell me, Gunhild, is this what Erhart himself demands of his life? MRS. BORKMAN. [Slightly taken aback.] Yes, I should hope so! ELLA RENTHEIM. Is it not rather what you demand of him? MRS. BORKMAN. [Curtly.] Erhart and I always make the same demands upon ourselves. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Sadly and slowly.] You are so very certain of your boy, then, Gunhild? MRS. BORKMAN. [With veiled triumph.] Yes, that I am--thank Heaven. You may be sure of that! ELLA RENTHEIM. Then I should think in reality you must be happy after all; in spite of all the rest. MRS. BORKMAN. So I am--so far as that goes. But then, every moment, all the rest comes rushing in upon me like a storm. ELLA RENTHEIM. [With a change of tone.] Tell me--you may as well tell me at once--for that is really what I have come for---- MRS. BORKMAN. What? ELLA RENTHEIM. Something I felt I must talk to you about.--Tell me--Erhart does not live out here with--with you others? MRS. BORKMAN. [Harshly.] Erhart cannot live out here with me. He has to live in town---- ELLA RENTHEIM. So he wrote to me. MRS. BORKMAN. He must, for the sake of his studies. But he comes out to me for a little while every evening. ELLA RENTHEIM. Well, may I see him then? May I speak to him at once? MRS. BORKMAN. He has not come yet; but I expect him every moment. ELLA RENTHEIM. Why, Gunhild, surely he must have come. I can hear his footsteps overhead. MRS. BORKMAN. [With a rapid upward glance.] Up in the long gallery? ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes. I have heard him walking up and down there ever since I came. MRS. BORKMAN.
