right--eh? Hovstad. I think so--if you have the "People's Messenger" behind you. Aslaksen. The Press is a power in a free community. Doctor. Dr. Stockmann. Quite so. And so is public opinion. And you, Mr. Aslaksen--I suppose you will be answerable for the Householders' Association? Aslaksen. Yes, and for the Temperance Society. You may rely on that. Dr. Stockmann. But, gentlemen--I really am ashamed to ask the question--but, what return do you--? Hovstad. We should prefer to help you without any return whatever, believe me. But the "People's Messenger" is in rather a shaky condition; it doesn't go really well; and I should be very unwilling to suspend the paper now, when there is so much work to do here in the political way. Dr. Stockmann. Quite so; that would be a great trial to such a friend of the people as you are. (Flares up.) But I am an enemy of the people, remember! (Walks about the room.) Where have I put my stick? Where the devil is my stick? Hovstad. What's that? Aslaksen. Surely you never mean-- Dr. Stockmann (standing still.) And suppose I don't give you a single penny of all I get out of it? Money is not very easy to get out of us rich folk, please to remember! Hovstad. And you please to remember that this affair of the shares can be represented in two ways! Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and you are just the man to do it. If I don't come to the rescue of the "People's Messenger," you will certainly take an evil view of the affair; you will hunt me down, I can well imagine--pursue me--try to throttle me as a dog does a hare. Hovstad. It is a natural law; every animal must fight for its own livelihood. Aslaksen. And get its food where it can, you know. Dr. Stockmann (walking about the room). Then you go and look for yours in the gutter; because I am going to show you which is the strongest animal of us three! (Finds an umbrella and brandishes it above his head.) Ah, now--! Hovstad. You are surely not going to use violence! Aslaksen. Take care what you are doing with that umbrella. Dr. Stockmann. Out of the window with you, Mr. Hovstad! Hovstad (edging to the door). Are you quite mad! Dr. Stockmann. Out of the window, Mr. Aslaksen! Jump, I tell you! You will have to do it, sooner or later. Aslaksen (running round the writing-table). Moderation, Doctor--I am a delicate man--I can stand so little--(calls out) help, help! (MRS. STOCKMANN, PETRA and HORSTER come in from the sitting-room.) Mrs. Stockmann. Good gracious, Thomas! What is happening? Dr. Stockmann (brandishing the umbrella). Jump out, I tell you! Out into the gutter! Hovstad. An assault on an unoffending man! I call you to witness, Captain Horster. (Hurries out through the hall.) Aslaksen (irresolutely). If only I knew the way about here--. (Steals out through the sitting-room.) Mrs. Stockmann (holding her husband back). Control yourself, Thomas! Dr. Stockmann (throwing down the umbrella). Upon my soul, they have escaped after all. Mrs. Stockmann. What did they want you to do? Dr. Stockmann. I will tell you later on; I have something else to think about now. (Goes to the table and writes something on a calling-card.) Look there, Katherine; what is written there? Mrs. Stockmann. Three big Noes; what does that mean. Dr. Stockmann. I will tell you that too, later on. (Holds out the card to PETRA.) There, Petra; tell sooty-face to run over to the "Badger's" with that, as quick as she can. Hurry up! (PETRA takes the card and goes out to the hall.) Dr. Stockmann. Well, I think I have had a visit from every one of the devil's messengers to-day! But now I am going to sharpen my pen till they can feel its point; I shall dip it in venom and gall; I shall hurl my inkpot at their heads! Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, but we are going away, you know, Thomas. (PETRA comes back.) Dr. Stockmann. Well? Petra. She has gone with it. Dr. Stockmann. Good.--Going away, did you say? No, I'll be hanged if we are going away! We are going to stay where we are, Katherine! Petra. Stay here? Mrs. Stockmann. Here, in the town? Dr. Stockmann. Yes, here. This is the field of battle--this is where the fight will be. This is where I shall triumph! As soon as I have had my trousers sewn up I shall go out and look for another house. We must have a roof over our heads for the winter. Horster. That you shall have in my house. Dr. Stockmann. Can I? Horsier. Yes, quite well. I have plenty of room, and I am almost never at home. Mrs. Stockmann. How good of you, Captain Horster! Petra. Thank you! Dr. Stockmann (grasping his hand). Thank you, thank you! That is one trouble over! Now I can set to work in earnest at once. There is an endless amount of things to look through here, Katherine! Luckily I shall have all my time at my disposal; because I have been dismissed from the Baths, you know. Mrs. Stockmann (with a sigh). Oh yes, I expected that. Dr. Stockmann. And they want to take my practice away from me too. Let them! I have got the poor people to fall back upon, anyway--those that
