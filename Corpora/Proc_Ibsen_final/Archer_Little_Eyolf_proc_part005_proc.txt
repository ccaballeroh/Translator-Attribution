again? RITA. [With a slight shrug.] Alfred will have it so, you know. ASTA. Yes; but I think you ought to put down your foot about it, Rita. RITA. [Somewhat impatiently.] Oh no; come now, I really cannot meddle with that. Alfred knows so much better about these things than I do. And what would you have Eyolf do? He can't run about and play, you see--like other children. ASTA. [With decision.] I will talk to Alfred about this. RITA. Yes, do; I wish you would.--Oh! here he is. [ALFRED ALLMERS, dressed in light summer clothes, enters by the door on the left, leading EYOLF by the hand. He is a slim, lightly-built man of about thirty-six or thirty-seven, with gentle eyes, and thin brown hair and beard. His expression is serious and thoughtful. EYOLF wears a suit cut like a uniform, with gold braid and gilt military buttons. He is lame, and walks with a crutch under his left arm. His leg is shrunken. He is undersized, and looks delicate, but has beautiful intelligent eyes.] ALLMERS. [Drops EYOLF's hand, goes up to ASTA with an expression of marked pleasure, and holds out both his hands to her.] Asta! My dearest Asta! To think of your coming! To think of my seeing you so soon! ASTA. I felt I must--. Welcome home again! ALLMERS. [Shaking her hands.] Thank you for coming. RITA. Doesn't he look well? ASTA. [Gazes fixedly at him.] Splendid! Quite splendid! His eyes are so much brighter! And I suppose you have done a great deal of writing on your travels? [With an outburst of joy.] I shouldn't wonder if you had finished the whole book, Alfred? ALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] The book? Oh, the book-- ASTA. Yes, I was sure you would find it go so easily when once you got away. ALLMERS. So I thought too. But, do you know, I didn't find it so at all. The truth is, I have not written a line of the book. ASTA. Not a line? RITA. Oho! I wondered when I found all the paper lying untouched in your bag. ASTA. But, my dear Alfred, what have you been doing all this time? ALLMERS. [Smiling.] Only thinking and thinking and thinking. RITA. [Putting her arm round his neck.] And thinking a little, too, of those you had left at home? ALLMERS. Yes, you may be sure of that. I have thought a great deal of you--every single day. RITA. [Taking her arm away.] Ah, that is all I care about. ASTA. But you haven't even touched the book! And yet you can look so happy and contented! That is not what you generally do--I mean when your work is going badly. ALLMERS. You are right there. You see, I have been such a fool hitherto. All the best that is in you goes into thinking. What you put on paper is worth very little. ASTA. [Exclaiming.] Worth very little! RITA. [Laughing.] What an absurd thing to say, Alfred. EYOLF. [Looks confidingly up at him.] Oh yes, Papa, what you write is worth a great deal! ALLMERS. [Smiling and stroking his hair.] Well, well, since you say so.--But I can tell you, some one is coming after me who will do it better. EYOLF. Who can that be? Oh, tell me! ALLMERS. Only wait--you may be sure he will come, and let us hear of him. EYOLF. And what will you do then? ALLMERS. [Seriously.] Then I will go to the mountains again-- RITA. Fie, Alfred! For shame! ALLMERS.--up to the peaks and the great waste places. EYOLF. Papa, don't you think I shall soon be well enough for you to take me with you? ALLMERS. [With painful emotion.] Oh, yes, perhaps, my little boy. EYOLF. It would be so splendid, you know, if I could climb the mountains, like you. ASTA. [Changing the subject.] Why, how beautifully you are dressed to-day, Eyolf! EYOLF. Yes, don't you think so, Auntie? ASTA. Yes, indeed. Is it in honour of Papa that you have got your new clothes on? EYOLF. Yes, I asked Mama to let me. I wanted so to let Papa see me in them. ALLMERS. [In a low voice, to RITA.] You shouldn't have given him clothes like that. RITA. [In a low voice.] Oh, he has teased me so long about them--he had set his heart on them. He gave me no peace. EYOLF. And I forgot to tell you, Papa--Borgheim has bought me a new bow. And he has taught me how to shoot with it too. ALLMERS. Ah, there now--that's just the sort of thing for you, Eyolf. EYOLF. And next time he comes, I shall ask him to teach me to swim, too. ALLMERS. To swim! Oh, what makes you want to learn swimming? EYOLF. Well, you know, all the boys down at the beach can swim. I am the only one that can't. ALLMERS. [With emotion, taking him in his arms.] You shall learn whatever you like--everything you really want to. EYOLF. Then do you know what I want most of all, Papa? ALLMERS. No; tell me. EYOLF. I want most of all to be a soldier. ALLMERS. Oh, little Eyolf, there are many, many other things that are better than that. EYOLF. Ah, but when I grow big, then I shall have to be a soldier. You know that, don't you? ALLMERS. [Clenching his hands together.] Well, well, well: we shall see-- ASTA. [Seating herself at the table on the left.] Eyolf! Come here to me, and I will tell you something.
