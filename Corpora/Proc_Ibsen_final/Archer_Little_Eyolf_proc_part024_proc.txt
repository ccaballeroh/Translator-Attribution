 RITA. [In fear.] Oh, sooner or later you will go away from me, Alfred! I feel it! I can see it in your face! You will go away from me. ALLMERS. With my fellow-traveller, do you mean? RITA. No, I mean worse than that. Of your own free will--you will leave me--for you think it's only here, with me, that you have nothing to live for. Is not that what is in your thoughts? ALLMERS. [Looking steadfastly at her.] What if it were--? [A disturbance, and the noise of angry, quarrelling voices is heard from down below, in the distance. ALLMERS goes to the railing.] RITA. What is that? [With an outburst.] Oh, you'll see, they have found him! ALLMERS. He will never be found. RITA. But what is it then? ALLMERS. [Coming forward.] Only fighting--as usual. RITA. Down on the beach? ALLMERS. Yes. The whole village down there ought to be swept away. Now the men have come home--drunk, as they always are. They are beating the children--do you hear the boys crying! The women are shrieking for help for them-- RITA. Should we not get some one to go down and help them? ALLMERS. [Harshly and angrily.] Help them, who did not help Eyolf! Let them go--as they let Eyolf go. RITA. Oh, you must not talk like that, Alfred! Nor think like that! ALLMERS. I cannot think otherwise. All the old hovels ought to be torn down. RITA. And then what is to become of all the poor people? ALLMERS. They must go somewhere else. RITA. And the children, too? ALLMERS. Does it make much difference where they go to the dogs? RITA. [Quietly and reproachfully.] You are forcing yourself into this harshness, Alfred. ALLMERS. [Vehemently.] I have a right to be harsh now! It is my duty. RITA. Your duty? ALLMERS. My duty to Eyolf. He must not lie unavenged. Once for all, Rita--it is as I tell you! Think it over! Have the whole place down there razed to the ground--when I am gone. RITA. [Looks intently at him.] When you are gone? ALLMERS. Yes. For that will at least give you something to fill your life with--and something you must have. RITA. [Firmly and decidedly.] There you are right---I must. But can you guess what I will set about--when you are gone? ALLMERS. Well, what? RITA. [Slowly and with resolution.] As soon as you are gone from me, I will go down to the beach, and bring all the poor neglected children home with me. All the mischievous boys-- ALLMERS. What will you do with them here? RITA. I will take them to my heart. ALLMERS. You! RITA. Yes, I will. From the day you leave me, they shall all be here, all of them, as if they were mine. ALLMERS. [Shocked.] In our little Eyolf's place! RITA. Yes, in our little Eyolf's place. They shall live in Eyolf's rooms. They shall read his books. They shall play with his toys. They shall take it in turns to sit in his chair at table. ALLMERS. But this is sheer madness in you! I do not know a creature in the world that is less fitted than you for anything of that sort. RITA. Then I shall have to educate myself for it; to train myself; to discipline myself. ALLMERS. If you are really in earnest about this--about all you say--then there must indeed be a change in you. RITA. Yes, there is, Alfred--and for that I have you to thank. You have made an empty place within me; and I must try to fill it up with something--with something that is a little like love. ALLMERS. [Stands for a moment lost in thought; then looks at her.] The truth is, we have not done much for the poor people down there. RITA. We have done nothing for them. ALLMERS. Scarcely even thought of them. RITA. Never thought of them in sympathy. ALLMERS. We, who had "the gold, and the green forests"-- RITA. Our hands were closed to them. And our hearts too. ALLMERS. [Nods.] Then it was perhaps natural enough, after all, that they should not risk their lives to save little Eyolf. RITA. [Softly.] Think, Alfred! Are you so certain that--that we would have risked ours? ALLMERS. [With an uneasy gesture of repulsion.] You must never doubt that. RITA. Oh, we are children of earth. ALLMERS. What do you really think you can do with all these neglected children? RITA. I suppose I must try if I cannot lighten and--and ennoble their lot in life. ALLMERS. If you can do that--then Eyolf was not born in vain. RITA. Nor taken from us in vain, either. ALLMERS. [Looking steadfastly at her.] Be quite clear about one thing, Rita--it is not love that is driving you to this. RITA. No, it is not--at any rate, not yet. ALLMERS. Well, then what is it? RITA. [Half-evasively.] You have so often talked to Asta of human responsibility-- ALLMERS. Of the book that you hated. RITA. I hate that book still. But I used to sit and listen to what you told her. And now I will try to continue it--in my own way. ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] It is not for the sake of that unfinished book-- RITA. No, I have another reason as well. ALLMERS. What is that? RITA. [Softly, with a melancholy smile.] I want to make my peace with the great, open eyes, you see.
