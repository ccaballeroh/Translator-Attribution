his lucid intervals; it was I that had to bear the whole burden of it when he began his excesses again or took to whining about his miserable condition. Manders. And this is the man you are building a memorial to! Mrs. Alving. There you see the power of an uneasy conscience. Manders. An uneasy conscience? What do you mean? Mrs. Alving. I had always before me the fear that it was impossible that the truth should not come out and be believed. That is why the Orphanage is to exist, to silence all rumours and clear away all doubt. Manders. You certainly have not fallen short of the mark in that, Mrs. Alving. Mrs. Alving. I had another very good reason. I did not wish Oswald, my own son, to inherit a penny that belonged to his father. Manders. Then it is with Mr. Alving's property. Mrs. Alving. Yes. The sums of money that, year after year, I have given towards this Orphanage, make up the amount of property--I have reckoned it carefully--which in the old days made Lieutenant Alving a catch. Manders. I understand. Mrs. Alving. That was my purchase money. I don't wish it to pass into Oswald's hands. My son shall have everything from me, I am determined. (OSWALD comes in by the farther door on the right. He has left his hat and coat outside.) Mrs. Alving. Back again, my own dear boy? Oswald. Yes, what can one do outside in this everlasting rain? I hear dinner is nearly ready. That's good! (REGINA comes in front the dining-room, carrying a parcel.) Regina. This parcel has come for you, ma'am. (Gives it to her.) Mrs. Alving (glancing at MANDERS). The ode to be sung tomorrow, I expect. Manders. Hm--! Regina. And dinner is ready. Mrs. Alving. Good. We will come in a moment. I will just--(begins to open the parcel). Regina (to OSWALD). Will you drink white or red wine, sir? Oswald. Both, Miss Engstrand. Regina. Bien--very good, Mr. Alving. (Goes into the dining-room.) Oswald. I may as well help you to uncork it--. (Follows her into the dining-room, leaving the door ajar after him.) Mrs. Alving. Yes, I thought so. Here is the ode, Mr Manders. Manders (clasping his hands). How shall I ever have the courage tomorrow to speak the address that-- Mrs. Alving. Oh, you will get through it. Manders (in a low voice, fearing to be heard in the dining room). Yes, we must raise no suspicions. Mrs. Alving (quietly but firmly). No; and then this long dreadful comedy will be at an end. After tomorrow, I shall feel as if my dead husband had never lived in this house. There will be no one else here then but my boy and his mother. (From the dining-room is heard the noise of a chair falling; then REGINA'S voice is heard in a loud whisper: Oswald! Are you mad? Let me go!) Mrs. Alving (starting in horror). Oh--! (She stares wildly at the half-open door. OSWALD is heard coughing and humming, then the sound of a bottle being uncorked.) Manders (in an agitated manner). What's the matter? What is it, Mrs. Alving? Mrs. Alving (hoarsely). Ghosts. The couple in the conservatory--over again. Manders. What are you saying! Regina--? Is SHE--! Mrs. Alving. Yes, Come. Not a word--! (Grips MANDERS by the arm and walks unsteadily with him into the dining-room.) ACT II (The same scene. The landscape is still obscured by Mist. MANDERS and MRS. ALVING come in from the dining-room.) Mrs. Alving (calls into the dining-room from the doorway). Aren't you coming in here, Oswald? Oswald. No, thanks; I think I will go out for a bit. Mrs. Alving. Yes, do; the weather is clearing a little. (She shuts the dining-room door, then goes to the hall door and calls.) Regina! Regina (from without). Yes, ma'am? Mrs. Alving. Go down into the laundry and help with the garlands. Regina. Yes, ma'am. (MRS. ALVING satisfies herself that she has gone, then shuts the door.) Manders. I suppose he can't hear us? Mrs. Alving. Not when the door is shut. Besides, he is going out. Manders. I am still quite bewildered. I don't know how I managed to swallow a mouthful of your excellent dinner. Mrs. Alving (walking up and down, and trying to control her agitation). Nor I. But, what are we to do? Manders. Yes, what are we to do? Upon my word I don't know; I am so completely unaccustomed to things of this kind. Mrs. Alving. I am convinced that nothing serious has happened yet. Manders. Heaven forbid! But it is most unseemly behaviour, for all that. Mrs. Alving. It is nothing more than a foolish jest of Oswald's, you may be sure. Manders. Well, of course, as I said, I am quite inexperienced in such matters; but it certainly seems to me-- Mrs. Alving. Out of the house she shall go--and at once. That part of it is as clear as daylight-- Manders. Yes, that is quite clear. Mrs. Alving. But where is she to go? We should not be justified in-- Manders. Where to? Home to her father, of course. Mrs. Alving. To whom, did you say? Manders. To her--. No, of course Engstrand isn't--. But, great heavens, Mrs. Alving, how is such a thing possible? You surely may have been
