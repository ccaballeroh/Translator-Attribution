ringing to-night! MRS. BORKMAN. No, but for me--and for him who has gone from me. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Nodding thoughtfully.] Who knows if, after all, they may not be ringing in life and happiness for him, Gunhild. MRS. BORKMAN. [With sudden animation, looking hard at her.] Life and happiness, you say! ELLA RENTHEIM. For a little while at any rate. MRS. BORKMAN. Could you endure to let him know life and happiness, with her? ELLA RENTHEIM. [With warmth and feeling.] Indeed, I could, with all my heart and soul! MRS. BORKMAN. [Coldly.] Then you must be richer than I am in the power of love. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Looking far away.] Perhaps it is the lack of love that keeps the power alive. MRS. BORKMAN. [Fixing her eyes on her.] If that is so, then I shall soon be as rich as you, Ella. [She turns and goes into the house. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Stands for a time looking with a troubled expression at BORKMAN; then lays her hand cautiously on his shoulder.] Come, John--you must come in, too. BORKMAN. [As if wakening.] I? ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, this winter air is too keen for you; I can see that, John. So come--come in with me--into the house, into the warmth. BORKMAN. [Angrily.] Up to the gallery again, I suppose. ELLA RENTHEIM. No, rather into the room below. BORKMAN. [His anger flaming forth.] Never will I set foot under that roof again! ELLA RENTHEIM. Where will you go then? So late, and in the dark, John? BORKMAN. [Putting on his hat.] First of all, I will go out and see to all my buried treasures. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Looking anxiously at him.] John--I don't understand you. BORKMAN. [With laughter, interrupted by coughing.] Oh, it is not hidden plunder I mean; don't be afraid of that, Ella. [Stopping, and pointing outwards.] Do you see that man there? Who is it? [VILHELM FOLDAL, in an old cape, covered with snow, with his hat-brim turned down, and a large umbrella in his hand, advances towards the corner of the house, laboriously stumbling through the snow. He is noticeably lame in his left foot. BORKMAN. Vilhelm! What do you want with me again? FOLDAL. [Looking up.] Good heavens, are you out on the steps, John Gabriel? [Bowing.] And Mrs. Borkman, too, I see. BORKMAN. [Shortly.] This is not Mrs. Borkman. FOLDAL. Oh, I beg pardon. You see, I have lost my spectacles in the snow. But how is it that you, who never put your foot out of doors----? BORKMAN. [Carelessly and gaily.] It is high time I should come out into the open air again, don't you see? Nearly three years in detention--five years in prison--eight years in the gallery up there---- ELLA RENTHEIM. [Distressed.] Borkman, I beg you---- FOLDAL. Ah yes, yes, yes! BORKMAN. But I want to know what has brought you here. FOLDAL. [Still standing at the foot of the steps.] I wanted to come up to you, John Gabriel. I felt I must come to you, in the gallery. Ah me, that gallery----! BORKMAN. Did you want to come up to me after I had shown you the door? FOLDAL. Oh, I couldn't let that stand in the way. BORKMAN. What have you done to your foot? I see you are limping? FOLDAL. Yes, what do you think--I have been run over. ELLA RENTHEIM. Run over! FOLDAL. Yes, by a covered sledge. BORKMAN. Oho! FOLDAL. With two horses. They came down the hill at a tearing gallop. I couldn't get out of the way quick enough; and so---- ELLA RENTHEIM. And so they ran over you? FOLDAL. They came right down upon me, madam--or miss. They came right upon me and sent me rolling over and over in the snow--so that I lost my spectacles and got my umbrella broken. [Rubbing his leg.] And my ankle a little hurt too. BORKMAN. [Laughing inwardly.] Do you know who were in that sledge, Vilhelm? FOLDAL. No, how could I see? It was a covered sledge, and the curtains were down. And the driver didn't stop a moment after he had sent me spinning. But it doesn't matter a bit, for---- [With an outburst.] Oh, I am so happy, so happy! BORKMAN. Happy? FOLDAL. Well, I don't exactly know what to call it. But I think happy is the nearest word. For something wonderful has happened! And that is why I couldn't help--I had to come out and share my happiness with you, John Gabriel. BORKMAN. [Harshly.] Well, share away then! ELLA RENTHEIM. Oh, but first take your friend indoors with you, Borkman. BORKMAN. [Sternly.] I have told you I will not go into the house. ELLA RENTHEIM. But don't you hear, he has been run over! BORKMAN. Oh, we are all of us run over, sometime or other in life. The thing is to jump up again, and let no one see you are hurt. FOLDAL. That is a profound saying, John Gabriel. But I can easily tell you my story out here, in a few words. BORKMAN. [More mildly.] Yes, please do, Vilhelm. FOLDAL. Well, now you shall hear! Only think, when I got home this evening after I had been with you, what did I find but a letter.
