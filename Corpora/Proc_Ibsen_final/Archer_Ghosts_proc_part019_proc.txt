expressing yourself. Now, let me just collect all the documents, and put them in my bag. [He does so.] There, that's all right. And now, good-bye for the present. Keep your eyes open when Oswald comes back. I shall look in again later. [He takes his hat and goes out through the hall door.] MRS. ALVING. [Sighs, looks for a moment out of the window, sets the room in order a little, and is about to go into the dining-room, but stops at the door with a half-suppressed cry.] Oswald, are you still at table? OSWALD. [In the dining room.] I'm only finishing my cigar. MRS. ALVING. I thought you had gone for a little walk. OSWALD. In such weather as this? [A glass clinks. MRS. ALVING leaves the door open, and sits down with her knitting on the sofa by the window.] OSWALD. Wasn't that Pastor Manders that went out just now? MRS. ALVING. Yes; he went down to the Orphanage. OSWALD. H'm. [The glass and decanter clink again.] MRS. ALVING. [With a troubled glance.] Dear Oswald, you should take care of that liqueur. It is strong. OSWALD. It keeps out the damp. MRS. ALVING. Wouldn't you rather come in here, to me? OSWALD. I mayn't smoke in there. MRS. ALVING. You know quite well you may smoke cigars. OSWALD. Oh, all right then; I'll come in. Just a tiny drop more first. There! [He comes into the room with his cigar, and shuts the door after him. A short silence.] Where has the pastor gone to? MRS. ALVING. I have just told you; he went down to the Orphanage. OSWALD. Oh, yes; so you did. MRS. ALVING. You shouldn't sit so long at table, Oswald. OSWALD. [Holding his cigar behind him.] But I find it so pleasant, mother. [Strokes and caresses her.] Just think what it is for me to come home and sit at mother's own table, in mother's room, and eat mother's delicious dishes. MRS. ALVING. My dear, dear boy! OSWALD. [Somewhat impatiently, walks about and smokes.] And what else can I do with myself here? I can't set to work at anything. MRS. ALVING. Why can't you? OSWALD. In such weather as this? Without a single ray of sunshine the whole day? [Walks up the room.] Oh, not to be able to work--! MRS. ALVING. Perhaps it was not quite wise of you to come home? OSWALD. Oh, yes, mother; I had to. MRS. ALVING. You know I would ten times rather forgo the joy of having you here, than let you-- OSWALD. [Stops beside the table.] Now just tell me, mother: does it really make you so very happy to have me home again? MRS. ALVING. Does it make me happy! OSWALD. [Crumpling up a newspaper.] I should have thought it must be pretty much the same to you whether I was in existence or not. MRS. ALVING. Have you the heart to say that to your mother, Oswald? OSWALD. But you've got on very well without me all this time. MRS. ALVING. Yes; I have got on without you. That is true. [A silence. Twilight slowly begins to fall. OSWALD paces to and fro across the room. He has laid his cigar down.] OSWALD. [Stops beside MRS. ALVING.] Mother, may I sit on the sofa beside you? MRS. ALVING. [Makes room for him.] Yes, do, my dear boy. OSWALD. [Sits down.] There is something I must tell you, mother. MRS. ALVING. [Anxiously.] Well? OSWALD. [Looks fixedly before him.] For I can't go on hiding it any longer. MRS. ALVING. Hiding what? What is it? OSWALD. [As before.] I could never bring myself to write to you about it; and since I've come home-- MRS. ALVING. [Seizes him by the arm.] Oswald, what is the matter? OSWALD. Both yesterday and to-day I have tried to put the thoughts away from me--to cast them off; but it's no use. MRS. ALVING. [Rising.] Now you must tell me everything, Oswald! OSWALD. [Draws her down to the sofa again.] Sit still; and then I will try to tell you.--I complained of fatigue after my journey-- MRS. ALVING. Well? What then? OSWALD. But it isn't that that is the matter with me; not any ordinary fatigue-- MRS. ALVING. [Tries to jump up.] You are not ill, Oswald? OSWALD. [Draws her down again.] Sit still, mother. Do take it quietly. I'm not downright ill, either; not what is commonly called "ill." [Clasps his hands above his head.] Mother, my mind is broken down--ruined--I shall never be able to work again! [With his hands before his face, he buries his head in her lap, and breaks into bitter sobbing.] MRS. ALVING. [White and trembling.] Oswald! Look at me! No, no; it's not true. OSWALD. [Looks up with despair in his eyes.] Never to be able to work again! Never!--never! A living death! Mother, can you imagine anything so horrible? MRS. ALVING. My poor boy! How has this horrible thing come upon you? OSWALD. [Sitting upright again.] That's just what I cannot possibly grasp or understand. I have never led a dissipated life--never, in any respect. You mustn't believe that of me, mother! I've never done that. MRS. ALVING. I am sure you haven't, Oswald. OSWALD. And yet this has come upon me just the same--this awful misfortune! MRS. ALVING. Oh, but it will pass over, my dear, blessed boy. It's nothing but over-work. Trust me, I am right.
