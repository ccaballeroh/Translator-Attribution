the most tremendous difficulties to overcome!--[With an outburst of gladness.]--Oh, what a glorious world this is--and what a joy it is to be a road-maker in it! RITA. [Smiling, and looking teasingly at him.] Is it road-making business that has brought you out here to-day in such wild spirits? BORGHEIM. No, not that alone. I am thinking of all the bright and hopeful prospects that are opening out before me. RITA. Aha, then perhaps you have something still more exquisite in reserve! BORGHEIM. [Glancing towards ASTA.] Who knows! When once happiness comes to us, it is apt to come like it spring flood. [Turns to ASTA.] Miss Allmers, would you not like to take a little walk with me? As we used to? ASTA. [Quickly.] No--no, thank you. Not now. Not to-day. BORGHEIM. Oh, do come! Only a little bit of a walk! I have so much I want to talk to you about before I go. RITA. Something else, perhaps, that you must not talk openly about as yet? BORGHEIM. H'm, that depends-- RITA. But there is nothing to prevent your whispering, you know. [Half aside.] Asta, you must really go with him. ASTA. But, my dear Rita-- BORGHEIM. [Imploringly.] Miss Asta--remember it is to be a farewell walk--the last for many a day. ASTA. [Takes her hat and parasol.] Very well, suppose we take a stroll in the garden, then. BORGHEIM. Oh, thank you, thank you! ALLMERS. And while you are there you can see what Eyolf is doing. BORGHEIM. Ah, Eyolf, by the bye! Where is Eyolf to-day? I've got something for him. ALLMERS. He is out playing somewhere. BORGHEIM. Is he really! Then he has begun to play now? He used always to be sitting indoors over his books. ALLMERS. There is to be an end of that now. I am going to make a regular open-air boy of him. BORGHEIM. Ah, now, that's right! Out into the open air with him, poor little fellow! Good Lord, what can we possibly do better than play in this blessed world? For my part, I think all life is one long playtime!--Come, Miss Asta! [BORGHEIM and ASTA go out on the verandah and down through the garden.] ALLMERS. [Stands looking after them.] Rita--do you think there is anything between those two? RITA. I don't know what to say. I used to think there was. But Asta has grown so strange to me--so utterly incomprehensible of late. ALLMERS. Indeed! Has she? While I have been away? RITA. Yes, within the last week or two. ALLMERS. And you think she doesn't care very much about him now? RITA. Not, seriously; not utterly and entirely; not unreservedly--I am sure she doesn't. [Looks searchingly at him.] Would it displease you if she did? ALLMERS. It would not exactly displease me. But it would certainly be a disquieting thought-- RITA. Disquieting? ALLMERS. Yes; you must remember that I am responsible for Asta--for her life's happiness. RITA. Oh, come--responsible! Surely Asta has come to years of discretion? I should say she was capable of choosing for herself. ALLMERS. Yes, we must hope so, Rita. RITA. For my part, I don't think at all ill of Borgheim. ALLMERS. No, dear--no more do I--quite the contrary. But all the same-- RITA. [Continuing.] And I should be very glad indeed if he and Asta were to make a match of it. ALLMERS. [Annoyed.] Oh, why should you be? RITA. [With increasing excitement.] Why, for then she would have to go far, far away with him! Anal she could never come out here to us, as she does now. ALLMERS. [Stares at her in astonishment.] What! Can you really wish Asta to go away? RITA. Yes, yes, Alfred! ALLMERS. Why in all the world--? RITA. [Throwing her arms passionately round his neck.] For then, at last, I should have you to myself alone! And yet--not even then! Not wholly to myself! [Bursts into convulsive weeping.] Oh, Alfred, Alfred--I cannot give you up! ALLMERS. [Gently releasing himself.] My dearest Rita, do be reasonable! RITA. I don't care a bit about being reasonable! I care only for you! Only for you in all the world! [Again throwing her arms round his neck.] For you, for you, for you! ALLMERS. Let me go, let me go--you are strangling me! RITA. [Letting him go.] How I wish I could! [Looking at him with flashing eyes.] Oh, if you knew how I have hated you--! ALLMERS. Hated me--! RITA. Yes--when you shut yourself up in your room and brooded over your work--till long, long into the night. [Plaintively.] So long, so late, Alfred. Oh, how I hated your work! ALLMERS. But now I have done with that. RITA. [With a cutting laugh.] Oh yes! Now you have given yourself up to something worse. ALLMERS. [Shocked.] Worse! Do you call our child something worse? RITA. [Vehemently.] Yes, I do. As he comes between you and me, I call him so. For the book--the book was not a living being, as the child is. [With increasing impetuosity.] But I won't endure it, Alfred! I will not endure it--I tell you so plainly! ALLMERS. [Looks steadily at her, and says in a low voice.] I am often almost afraid of you, Rita. RITA. [Gloomily.] I am often afraid of myself. And for that very reason
