Then they lowered me into a grave-vault, with iron bars before the loop-hole. And with padded walls--so that no one on the earth above could hear the grave-shrieks--. But now I am beginning, in a way, to rise from the dead. [She seats herself again.] PROFESSOR RUBEK. [After a pause.] In all this, do you hold me guilty? IRENE. Yes. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Guilty of that--your death, as you call it. IRENE. Guilty of the fact that I had to die. [Changing her tone to one of indifference.] Why don't you sit down, Arnold? PROFESSOR RUBEK. May I? IRENE. Yes.--You need not be afraid of being frozen. I don't think I am quite turned to ice yet. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Moves a chair and seats himself at her table.] There, Irene. Now we two are sitting together as in the old days. IRENE. A little way apart from each other--also as in the old days. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Moving nearer.] It had to be so, then. IRENE. Had it? PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Decisively.] There had to be a distance between us-- IRENE. Was it absolutely necessary, Arnold? PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Continuing.] Do you remember what you answered when I asked if you would go with me out into the wide world? IRENE. I held up three fingers in the air and swore that I would go with you to the world's end and to the end of life. And that I would serve you in all things-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. As the model for my art-- IRENE. --in frank, utter nakedness-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. [With emotion.] And you did serve me, Irene--so bravely--so gladly and ungrudgingly. IRENE. Yes, with all the pulsing blood of my youth, I served you! PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Nodding, with a look of gratitude.] That you have every right to say. IRENE. I fell down at your feet and served you, Arnold! [Holding her clenched hand towards him.] But you, you,--you--! PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Defensively.] I never did you any wrong! Never, Irene! IRENE. Yes, you did! You did wrong to my innermost, inborn nature-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Starting back.] I--! IRENE. Yes, you! I exposed myself wholly and unreservedly to your gaze--[More softly.] And never once did you touch me. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Irene, did you not understand that many a time I was almost beside myself under the spell of all your loveliness? IRENE. [Continuing undisturbed.] And yet--if you had touched me, I think I should have killed you on the spot. For I had a sharp needle always upon me--hidden in my hair-- [Strokes her forehead meditatively.] But after all--after all--that you could-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Looks impressively at her.] I was an artist, Irene. IRENE. [Darkly.] That is just it. That is just it. PROFESSOR RUBEK. An artist first of all. And I was sick with the desire to achieve the great work of my life. [Losing himself in recollection.] It was to be called "The Resurrection Day"--figured in the likeness of a young woman, awakening from the sleep of death-- IRENE. Our child, yes-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Continuing.] It was to be the awakening of the noblest, purest, most ideal woman the world ever saw. Then I found you. You were what I required in every respect. And you consented so willingly--so gladly. You renounced home and kindred--and went with me. IRENE. To go with you meant for me the resurrection of my childhood. PROFESSOR RUBEK. That was just why I found in you all that I required--in you and in no one else. I came to look on you as a thing hallowed, not to be touched save in adoring thoughts. In those days I was still young, Irene. And the superstition took hold of me that if I touched you, if I desired you with my senses, my soul would be profaned, so that I should be unable to accomplish what I was striving for.--And I still think there was some truth in that. IRENE. [Nods with a touch of scorn.] The work of art first--then the human being. PROFESSOR RUBEK. You must judge me as you will; but at that time I was utterly dominated by my great task--and exultantly happy in it. IRENE. And you achieved your great task, Arnold. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Thanks and praise be to you, I achieved my great task. I wanted to embody the pure woman as I saw her awakening on the Resurrection Day. Not marvelling at anything new and unknown and undivined; but filled with a sacred joy at finding herself unchanged--she, the woman of earth--in the higher, freer, happier region--after the long, dreamless sleep of death. [More softly.] Thus did I fashion her.--I fashioned her in your image, Irene. IRENE. [Laying her hands flat upon the table and leaning against the back of her chair.] And then you were done with me-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Reproachfully.] Irene! IRENE. You had no longer any use for me-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. How can you say that! IRENE. --and began to look about you for other ideals-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. I found none, none after you. IRENE. And no other models, Arnold? PROFESSOR RUBEK. You were no model to me. You were the fountainhead of my achievement. IRENE.
