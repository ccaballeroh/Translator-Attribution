have a sort of parental care looking after them. Menders. What do you say to that, Mrs. Alving! Engstrand. I haven't much to begin such a work with, I know; but Heaven might prosper it, and if I found any helping hand stretched out to me, then-- Manders. Quite so; we will talk over the matter further. Your project attracts me enormously. But in the meantime go back to the Orphanage and put everything tidy and light the lights, so that the occasion may seem a little solemn. And then we will spend a little edifying time together, my dear Engstrand, for now I am sure you are in a suitable frame of mind. Engstrand. I believe I am, sir, truly. Goodbye, then, Mrs. Alving, and thank you for all your kindness; and take good care of Regina for me. (Wipes a tear from his eye.) Poor Joanna's child--it is an extraordinary thing, but she seems to have grown into my life and to hold me by the heartstrings. That's how I feel about it, truly. (Bows, and goes out.) Manders. Now then, what do you think of him, Mrs Alving! That was quite another explanation that he gave us. Mrs. Alving. It was, indeed. Manders. There, you see how exceedingly careful we ought to be in condemning our fellow-men. But at the same time it gives one genuine pleasure to find that one was mistaken. Don't you think so? Mrs. Alving. What I think is that you are, and always will remain, a big baby, Mr. Manders. Menders. I? Mrs. Alving (laying her hands on his shoulders). And I think that I should like very much to give you a good hug. Manders (drawing beck hastily). No, no, good gracious! What an idea! Mrs. Alving (with a smile). Oh, you needn't be afraid of me. Manders (standing by the table). You choose such an extravagant way of expressing yourself sometimes. Now I must get these papers together and put them in my bag. (Does so.) That's it. And now goodbye, for the present. Keep your eyes open when Oswald comes back. I will come back and see you again presently. (He takes his hat and goes out by the hall door. MRS. ALVING sighs, glances out of the window, puts one or two things tidy in the room and turns to go into the dining-room. She stops in the doorway with a stifled cry.) Mrs. Alving. Oswald, are you still sitting at table! Oswald (from the dining-room). I am only finishing my cigar. Mrs. Alving. I thought you had gone out for a little turn. Oswald (from within the room). In weather like this? (A glass is heard clinking. MRS. ALVING leaves the door open and sits down with her knitting on the couch by the window.) Wasn't that Mr. Manders that went out just now? Mrs. Alving. Yes, he has gone over to the Orphanage. Oswald. Oh. (The clink of a bottle on a glass is heard again.) Mrs. Alving (with an uneasy expression.) Oswald, dear, you should be careful with that liqueur. It is strong. Oswald. It's a good protective against the damp. Mrs. Alving. Wouldn't you rather come in here? Oswald. You know you don't like smoking in there. Mrs. Alving. You may smoke a cigar in here, certainly. Oswald. All right; I will come in, then. Just one drop more. There! (Comes in, smoking a cigar, and shuts the door after him. A short silence.) Where has the parson gone? Mrs. Alving. I told you he had gone over to the Orphanage. Oswald. Oh, so you did. Mrs. Alving. You shouldn't sit so long at table, Oswald, Oswald (holding his cigar behind his back). But it's so nice and cosy, mother dear. (Caresses her with one hand.) Think what it means to me--to have come home; to sit at my mother's own table, in my mother's own room, and to enjoy the charming meals she gives me. Mrs. Alving. My dear, dear boy! Oswald (a little impatiently, as he walks tip and down smoking.) And what else is there for me to do here? I have no occupation-- Mrs. Alving. No occupation? Oswald. Not in this ghastly weather, when there isn't a blink of sunshine all day long. (Walks up and down the floor.) Not to be able to work, it's--! Mrs. Alving. I don't believe you were wise to come home. Oswald. Yes, mother; I had to. Mrs. Alving. Because I would ten times rather give up the happiness of having you with me, sooner than that you should-- Oswald (standing still by the table). Tell me, mother--is it really such a great happiness for you to have me at home? Mrs. Alving. Can you ask? Oswald (crumpling up a newspaper). I should have thought it would have been pretty much the same to you whether I were here or away. Mrs. Alving. Have you the heart to say that to your mother, Oswald? Oswald. But you have been quite happy living without me so far. Mrs. Alving. Yes, I have lived without you--that is true. (A silence. The dusk falls by degrees. OSWALD walks restlessly up and down. He has laid aside his cigar.) Oswald (stopping beside MRS. ALVING). Mother, may I sit on the couch beside you? Mrs. Alving. Of course, my dear boy. Oswald (sitting down). Now I must tell you something mother. Mrs. Alving (anxiously). What? Oswald (staring in front of him). I can't bear it any longer.
