aims in view. The act would have been a different act. In short, I have acquitted myself. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Softly and appealingly.] Oh, can you say that so confidently, Borkman? BORKMAN. [Nodding.] Acquitted myself on that score. But then comes the great, crushing self-accusation. MRS. BORKMAN. What is that? BORKMAN. I have skulked up there and wasted eight precious years of my life! The very day I was set free, I should have gone forth into the world--out into the steel-hard, dreamless world of reality! I should have begun at the bottom and swung myself up to the heights anew--higher than ever before--in spite of all that lay between. MRS. BORKMAN. Oh, it would have been the same thing over again; take my word for that. BORKMAN. [Shakes his head, and looks at her with a sententious air.] It is true that nothing new happens; but what has happened does not repeat itself either. It is the eye that transforms the action. The eye, born anew, transforms the old action. [Breaking off.] But you do not understand this. MRS. BORKMAN. [Curtly.] No, I do not understand it. BORKMAN. Ah, that is just the curse--I have never found one single soul to understand me. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Looking at him.] Never, Borkman? BORKMAN. Except one--perhaps. Long, long ago. In the days when I did not think I needed understanding. Since then, at any rate, no one has understood me! There has been no one alive enough to my needs to be afoot and rouse me--to ring the morning bell for me--to call me up to manful work anew. And to impress upon me that I had done nothing inexpiable. MRS. BORKMAN. [With a scornful laugh.] So, after all, you require to have that impressed on you from without? BORKMAN. [With increasing indignation.] Yes, when the whole world hisses in chorus that I have sunk never to rise again, there come moments when I almost believe it myself. [Raising his head.] But then my inmost assurance rises again triumphant; and that acquits me. MRS. BORKMAN. [Looking harshly at him.] Why have you never come and asked me for what you call understanding? BORKMAN. What use would it have been to come to you? MRS. BORKMAN. [With a gesture of repulsion.] You have never loved anything outside yourself; that is the secret of the whole matter. BORKMAN. [Proudly.] I have loved power. MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, power! BORKMAN. The power to create human happiness in wide, wide circles around me! MRS. BORKMAN. You had once the power to make me happy. Have you used it to that end? BORKMAN. [Without looking at her.] Some one must generally go down in a shipwreck. MRS. BORKMAN. And your own son! Have you used your power--have you lived and laboured--to make him happy? BORKMAN. I do not know him. MRS. BORKMAN. No, that is true. You do not even know him. BORKMAN. [Harshly.] You, his mother, have taken care of that! MRS. BORKMAN. [Looking at him with a lofty air.] Oh, you do not know what I have taken care of! BORKMAN. You? MRS. BORKMAN. Yes, I. I alone. BORKMAN. Then tell me. MRS. BORKMAN. I have taken care of your memory. BORKMAN. [With a short dry laugh.] My memory? Oh, indeed! It sounds almost as if I were dead already. MRS. BORKMAN. [With emphasis.] And so you are. BORKMAN. [Slowly.] Yes, perhaps you are right. [Firing up.] But no, no! Not yet! I have been close to the verge of death. But now I have awakened. I have come to myself. A whole life lies before me yet. I can see it awaiting me, radiant and quickening. And you--you shall see it too. MRS. BORKMAN. [Raising her hand.] Never dream of life again! Lie quiet where you are. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Shocked.] Gunhild! Gunhild, how can you----! MRS. BORKMAN. [Not listening to her.] I will raise the monument over your grave. BORKMAN. The pillar of shame, I suppose you mean? MRS. BORKMAN. [With increasing excitement.] Oh, no, it shall be no pillar of metal or stone. And no one shall be suffered to carve any scornful legend on the monument I shall raise. There shall be, as it were, a quickset hedge of trees and bushes, close, close around your tomb. They shall hide away all the darkness that has been. The eyes of men and the thoughts of men shall no longer dwell on John Gabriel Borkman! BORKMAN. [Hoarsely and cuttingly.] And this labour of love you will perform? MRS. BORKMAN. Not by my own strength. I cannot think of that. But I have brought up one to help me, who shall live for this alone. His life shall be so pure and high and bright, that your burrowing in the dark shall be as though it had never been! BORKMAN. [Darkly and threateningly.] If it is Erhart you mean, say so at once! MRS. BORKMAN. [Looking him straight in the eyes.] Yes, it is Erhart; my son; he whom you are ready to renounce in atonement for your own acts. BORKMAN. [With a look towards ELLA.] In atonement for my blackest sin. MRS. BORKMAN. [Repelling the idea.] A sin towards a stranger only. Remember
