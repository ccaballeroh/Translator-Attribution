please. ASTA. No, I won't let you sit there. ALLMERS. Yes, let me. ASTA. No, don't. For then you will only sit looking out--[Forces him down upon a chair, with his back to the right.] There now. Now that's right. [Seats herself upon the bench.] And now we can talk a little again. ALLMERS. [Drawing a deep breath audibly.] It was good to deaden the sorrow and heartache for a moment. ASTA. You insist do so, Alfred. ALLMERS. But don't you think it is terribly weak and unfeeling of me--to be able to do so? ASTA. Oh, no--I am sure it is impossible to keep circling for ever round one fixed thought. ALLMERS. Yes, for me it is impossible. Before you came to me, here I sat, torturing myself unspeakably with this crushing, gnawing sorrow-- ASTA. Yes? ALLMERS. And would you believe it, Asta--? H'm-- ASTA. Well? ALLMERS. In the midst of all the agony, I found myself speculating what we should have for dinner to-day. ASTA. [Soothingly.] Well, well, if only it rests you to-- ALLMERS. Yes, just fancy, dear--it seemed as if it did give me rest. [Holds out, his hand to her across the table.] How good it is, Asta, that I have you with me. I am so glad of that. Glad, glad--even in my sorrow. ASTA. [Looking earnestly at him.] You ought most of all to be glad that you have Rita. ALLMERS. Yes, of course I should. But Rita is no kin to me--it isn't like having a sister. ASTA. [Eagerly.] Do you say that, Alfred? ALLMERS. Yes, our family is a thing apart. [Half jestingly.] We have always had vowels for our initials. Don't you remember how often we used to speak of that? And all our relations--all equally poor. And we have all the same colour of eyes. ASTA. Do you think I have--? ALLMERS. No, you take entirely after your mother. You are not in the least like the rest of us--not even like father. But all the same-- ASTA. All the same--? ALLMERS. Well, I believe that living together has, as it were, stamped us in each other's image--mentally, I mean. ASTA. [With warm emotion.] Oh, you must never say that, Alfred. It is only I that have taken my stamp from you; and it is to you that I owe everything--every good thing in the world. ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] You owe me nothing, Asta. On the contrary-- ASTA. I owe you everything! You must never doubt that. No sacrifice has been too great for you-- ALLMERS. [Interrupting.] Oh, nonsense--sacrifice! Don't talk of such a thing.--I have only loved you, Asta, ever since you were a little child. [After a short pause.] And then it always seemed to me that I had so much injustice to make up to you for. ASTA. [Astonished.] Injustice? You? ALLMERS. Not precisely on my own account. But-- ASTA. [Eagerly.] But--? ALLMERS. On father's. ASTA. [Half rising from the bench.] On--father's! [Sitting down again.] What do you mean by that, Alfred? ALLMERS. Father was never really kind to you. ASTA. [Vehemently.] Oh, don't say that! ALLMERS. Yes, it is true. He did not love you--not as he ought to have. ASTA. [Evasively.] No, perhaps not as he loved you. That was only natural. ALLMERS. [Continuing.] And he was often hard to your mother, too--at least in the last years. ASTA. [Softly.] Mother was so much, much younger than he--remember that. ALLMERS. Do you think they were not quite suited to each other? ASTA. Perhaps not. ALLMERS. Yes, but still--. Father, who in other ways was so gentle and warm-hearted--so kindly towards every one-- ASTA. [Quietly.] Mother, too, was not always as she ought to have been. ALLMERS. Your mother was not! ASTA. Perhaps not always. ALLMERS. Towards father, do you mean? ASTA. Yes. ALLMERS. I never noticed that. ASTA. [Struggling with her tears, rises.] Oh, my dear Alfred--let them rest--those who are gone. [She goes towards the right.] ALLMERS. [Rising.] Yes, let them rest. [Wringing his hands.] But those who are gone--it is they that won't let us rest, Asta. Neither day nor night. ASTA. [Looks warmly at him.] Time will make it all seem easier, Alfred. ALLMERS. [Looking helplessly at her.] Yes, don't you think it will?--But how I am to get over these terrible first days [Hoarsely.]--that is what I cannot imagine. ASTA. [Imploringly, laying her hands on his shoulders.] Go up to Rita. Oh, please do-- ALLMERS. [Vehemently, withdrawing from her.] No, no, no--don't talk to me of that! I cannot, I tell you. [More calmly.] Let me remain here, with you. ASTA. Well, I will not leave you. ALLMERS. [Seizing her hand and holding it fast.] Thank you for that! [Looks out for a time over the fiord.] Where is my little Eyolf now? [Smiling sadly to her.] Can you tell me that my big, wise Eyolf? [Shaking his head.] No one in all the world can tell me that. I know only this one terrible thing--that he is gone from me. ASTA. [Looking up to the left, and withdrawing her hand.] Here they are coming. [MRS. ALLMERS and Engineer BORGHEIM come down by the wood-path, she leading the way. She wears a dark dress and a black veil over her head. He has an umbrella under his arm.]
