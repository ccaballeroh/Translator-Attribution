 PROFESSOR RUBEK. There we will hold our marriage-feast, Irene--oh, my beloved! IRENE. [Proudly.] The sun may freely look on us, Arnold. PROFESSOR RUBEK. All the powers of light may freely look on us--and all the powers of darkness too. [Seizes her hand.] Will you then follow me, oh my grace-given bride? IRENE. [As though transfigured.] I follow you, freely and gladly, my lord and master! PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Drawing her along with him.] We must first pass through the mists, Irene, and then-- IRENE. Yes, through all the mists, and then right up to the summit of the tower that shines in the sunrise. [The mist-clouds close in over the scene--PROFESSOR RUBEK and IRENE, hand in hand, climb up over the snow-field to the right and soon disappear among the lower clouds.

PROFESSOR RUBEK and IRENE can be dimly discerned as they are whirled along with the masses of snow and buried in them. THE SISTER OF MERCY.
