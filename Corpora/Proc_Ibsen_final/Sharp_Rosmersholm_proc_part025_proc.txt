dissuaded her from doing so. Rebecca. You know she had taken it into her head that she, a childless wife, had no right to be here. And so she persuaded herself that her duty to you was to give place to another. Rosmer. And you--you did nothing to rid her mind of such an idea? Rebecca. No. Kroll. Perhaps you encouraged her in the idea? Answer! Did you not do so? Rebecca. That was how she understood me, I believe. Rosmer. Yes, yes--and she bowed to your will in everything. And so she gave place. (Springs up.) How could you--how could you go on with this terrible tragedy! Rebecca. I thought there were two lives here to choose between, John. Kroll (severely and with authority). You had no right to make any such choice. Rebecca (impetuously). Surely you do not think I acted with cold and calculating composure! I am a different woman now, when I am telling you this, from what I was then. And I believe two different kinds of will can exist at the same time in one person. I wanted Beata away--in one way or the other; but I never thought it would happen, all the same. At every step I ventured and risked, I seemed to hear a voice in me crying: "No further! Not a step further!" And yet, at the same time, I COULD not stop. I HAD to venture a little bit further--just one step. And then another--and always another--and at last it happened. That is how such things go of themselves. (A short silence.) Rosmer (to REBECCA). And how do you think it will go with YOU in the future?--after this? Rebecca. Things must go with me as they can. It is of very little consequence. Kroll. Not a word suggestive of remorse! Perhaps you feel none? Rebecca (dismissing his remark coldly). Excuse me, Mr. Kroll, that is a matter that is no concern of any one else's. That is an account I must settle with myself. Kroll (to ROSMER). And this is the woman you have been living under the same roof with--in relations of the completest confidence. (Looks up at the portraits on the walls.) If only those that are gone could look down now! Rosmer. Are you going into the town? Kroll (taking up his hat). Yes. The sooner the better. Rosmer (taking his hat also). Then I will go with you. Kroll. You will! Ah, I thought we had not quite lost you. Rosmer. Come, then, Kroll. Come! (They both go out into the hall without looking at REBECCA. After a minute REBECCA goes cautiously to the window and peeps out between the flowers.) Rebecca (speaking to herself, half aloud). Not over the bridge to-day either. He is going round. Never over the millrace--never. (Comes away from the window.) As I thought! (She goes over to the bell, and rings it. Soon afterwards MRS. HELSETH comes in from the right.) Mrs. Helseth. What is it, miss? Rebecca. Mrs. Helseth, will you be so good as to fetch my travelling trunk down from the loft? Mrs. Helseth. Your trunk? Rebecca. Yes, the brown hair-trunk, you know. Mrs. Helseth. Certainly, miss. But, bless my soul, are you going away on a journey, miss? Rebecca. Yes--I am going away on a journey, Mrs. Helseth. Mrs. Helseth. And immediately! Rebecca. As soon as I have packed. Mrs. Helseth. I never heard of such a thing! But you are coming back again soon, I suppose, miss? Rebecca. I am never coming back again. Mrs. Helseth. Never! But, my goodness, what is to become of us at Rosmersholm if Miss West is not here any longer? Just as everything was making poor Mr. Rosmer so happy and comfortable! Rebecca. Yes, but to-day I have had a fright, Mrs. Helseth. Mrs. Helseth. A fright! Good heavens-how? Rebecca. I fancy I have had a glimpse of the White Horse. Mrs. Helseth. Of the White Horse! In broad daylight! Rebecca. Ah! they are out both early and late, the White Horses of Rosmersholm. (Crosses the room.) Well--we were speaking of my trunk, Mrs. Helseth. Mrs. Helseth. Yes, miss. Your trunk. (They both go out to the right.) ACT IV (SCENE.--The same room in the late evening. The lamp, with a shade on it, is burning on the table. REBECCA is standing by the table, packing some small articles in a travelling-bag. Her cloak, hat, and the white crochetted shawl are hanging on the back of the couch. MRS. HELSETH comes in from the right.) Mrs. Helseth (speaking in low tones and with a reserved manner). Yes, all your things have been taken down, miss. They are in the kitchen passage. Rebecca. Thank you. You have ordered the carriage? Mrs. Helseth. Yes, miss. The coachman wants to know what time he shall bring it round. Rebecca. I think at about eleven o'clock. The boat goes at midnight. Mrs. Helseth (with a little hesitation). But what about Mr. Rosmer? Suppose he is not back by that time? Rebecca. I shall start, all the same. If I should not see him, you can tell him I will write to him--a long letter, say that. Mrs. Helseth. Yes, I dare say it will be all right to write. But, poor dear, I really think that you ought to try and have a talk with him once more. Rebecca. Perhaps I ought--Or perhaps not, after all.
