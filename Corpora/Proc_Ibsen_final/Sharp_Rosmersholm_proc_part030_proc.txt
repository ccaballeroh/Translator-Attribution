that you have great love in your heart; that your soul has been ennobled through me. Is that so? Have you counted the cost? Shall we try and balance our accounts? Tell me. Rebecca. I am quite ready. Rosmer. Then when shall it be? Rebecca. Whenever you like. The sooner the better. Rosmer. Then let me see, Rebecca, whether you--for my sake-this very night--. (Breaks off.) Oh, no, no! Rebecca. Yes, John! Yes, yes! Say it, and you shall see. Rosmer. Have you the courage--are you willing--gladly, as Ulrik Brendel said--for my sake, to-night--gladly--to go the same way--that Beata went! Rebecca (gets up slowly from the couch, and says almost inaudibly): John--! Rosmer. Yes, dear--that is the question I shall never be able to rid my thoughts of, when you have gone away. Every hour of the day I shall come back to it. Ah, I seem to see you bodily before me--standing out on the foot-bridge-right out in the middle. Now you lean out over the railing! You grow dizzy as you feel drawn down towards the mill-race! No--you recoil. You dare not do--what she dared. Rebecca. But if I had the courage?--and willingly and gladly? What then? Rosmer. Then I would believe in you. Then I should get back my faith in my mission in life--my faith in my power to ennoble my fellow men--my faith in mankind's power to be ennobled. Rebecca (takes up her shawl slowly, throws it over her head, and says, controlling herself): You shall have your faith back. Rosmer. Have you the courage and the strength of will for that, Rebecca? Rebecca. Of that you must judge in the morning--or later--when they take up my body. Rosmer (burying his head in his hands). There is a horrible temptation in this--! Rebecca. Because I should not like to be left lying there--any longer than need be. You must take care that they find me. Rosmer (springing up). But all this is madness, you know. Go away, or stay! I will believe you on your bare word this time too. Rebecca. Those are mere words, John. No more cowardice or evasion! How can you believe me on my bare word after today? Rosmer. But I do not want to see your defeat, Rebecca. Rebecca. There will be no defeat. Rosmer. There will. You will never have the heart to go Beata's way. Rebecca. Do you believe that? Rosmer. Never. You are not like Beata. You are not under the influence of a distorted view of life. Rebecca. But I am under the influence of the Rosmersholm view of Life--now. Whatever my offences are--it is right that I should expiate them. Rosmer (looking at her fixedly). Have you come to that decision? Rebecca. Yes. Rosmer. Very well. Then I too am under the influence of our unfettered view of life, Rebecca. There is no one that can judge us. And therefore we must be our own judges. Rebecca (misunderstanding his meaning). That too. That too. My leaving you will save the best that is in you. Rosmer. Ah, there is nothing left to save in me. Rebecca. There is. But I--after this I should only be like some sea-sprite hanging on to the barque you are striving to sail forward in, and, hampering its progress. I must go overboard. Do you think I could go through the world bearing the burden of a spoiled life--brooding for ever over the happiness which I have forfeited by my past? I must throw up the game, John. Rosmer. If you go--then I go with you. Rebecca (looks at him with an almost imperceptible smile, and says more gently): Yes, come with me, dear--and be witness-- Rosmer. I go with you, I said. Rebecca. As far as the bridge--yes. You never dare go out on to it, you know. Rosmer. Have you noticed that? Rebecca (in sad and broken tones). Yes. That was what made my love hopeless. Rosmer. Rebecca--now I lay my hand on your head. (Does as he says.) And I take you for my true and lawful wife. Rebecca (taking both his hands in hers, and bowing her head on to his breast). Thank you, John. (Lets him go.) And now I am going--gladly. Rosmer. Man and wife should go together. Rebecca. Only as far as the bridge, John. Rosmer. And out on to it, too. As far as you go--so far I go with you. I dare do it now. Rebecca. Are you absolutely certain that way is the best for you? Rosmer. I know it is the only way. Rebecca. But suppose you are only deceiving yourself? Suppose it were only a delusion--one of these White Horses of Rosmersholm? Rosmer. It may be so. We can never escape from them--we of my race. Rebecca. Then stay, John! Rosmer. The man shall cleave to his wife, as the wife to her husband. Rebecca. Yes, but first tell me this--is it you that go with me, or I that go with you? Rosmer. We shall never get to the bottom of that. Rebecca. Yet I should dearly like to know. Rosmer. We two go with each other, Rebecca. I with you, and you with me. Rebecca. I almost believe that is true. Rosmer. For now we two are one. Rebecca. Yes. We are one now. Come! We can go gladly now. (They go out, hand in hand, through the hall, and are seen to turn to the left. The door stands open after them. The room is empty for a little while.
