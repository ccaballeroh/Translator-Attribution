 [At some distance over the upland, on the other side of the brook, a troop of children is singing, dancing, and playing. Some are dressed in peasant costume, others in town-made clothes. Their happy laughter is heard, softened by distance, during the following. [PROFESSOR RUBEK is sitting on the bench, with a plaid over his shoulders, and looking down at the children's play. [Presently, MAIA comes forward from among some bushes on the upland to the left, well back, and scans the prospect with her hand shading her eyes. She wears a flat tourist cap, a short skirt, kilted up, reaching only midway between ankle and knee, and high, stout lace-boots. She has in her hand a long alpenstock. MAIA. [At last catches sight of RUBEK and calls.] Hallo! [She advances over the upland, jumps over the brook, with the aid of her alpenstock, and climbs up the hillock. MAIA. [Panting.] Oh, how I have been rushing around looking for you, Rubek. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Nods indifferently and asks.] Have you just come from the hotel? MAIA. Yes, that was the last place I tried--that fly-trap. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Looking at her for moment.] I noticed that you were not at the dinner-table. MAIA. No, we had our dinner in the open air, we two. PROFESSOR RUBEK. "We two"? What two? MAIA. Why, I and that horrid bear-killer, of course. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Oh, he. MAIA. Yes. And first thing to-morrow morning we are going off again. PROFESSOR RUBEK. After bears? MAIA. Yes. Off to kill a brown-boy. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Have you found the tracks of any? MAIA. [With superiority.] You don't suppose that bears are to be found in the naked mountains, do you? PROFESSOR RUBEK. Where, then? MAIA. Far beneath. On the lower slopes; in the thickest parts of the forest. Places your ordinary town-folk could never get through-- PROFESSOR RUBEK. And you two are going down there to-morrow? MAIA. [Throwing herself down among the heather.] Yes, so we have arranged.--Or perhaps we may start this evening.--If you have no objection, that's to say? PROFESSOR RUBEK. I? Far be it from me to-- MAIA. [Quickly.] Of course Lars goes with us--with the dogs. PROFESSOR RUBEK. I feel no curiosity as to the movements of Mr. Lars and his dogs. [Changing the subject.] Would you not rather sit properly on the seat? MAIA. [Drowsily.] No, thank you. I'm lying so delightfully in the soft heather. PROFESSOR RUBEK. I can see that you are tired. MAIA. [Yawning.] I almost think I'm beginning to feel tired. PROFESSOR RUBEK. You don't notice it till afterwards--when the excitement is over-- MAIA. [In a drowsy tone.] Just so. I will lie and close my eyes. [A short pause. MAIA. [With sudden impatience.] Ugh, Rubek--how can you endure to sit there listening to these children's screams! And to watch all the capers they are cutting, too! PROFESSOR RUBEK. There is something harmonious--almost like music--in their movements, now and then; amid all the clumsiness. And it amuses me to sit and watch for these isolated moments--when they come. MAIA. [With a somewhat scornful laugh.] Yes, you are always, always an artist. PROFESSOR RUBEK. And I propose to remain one. MAIA. [Lying on her side, so that her back is turned to him.] There's not a bit of the artist about him. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [With attention.] Who is it that's not an artist? MAIA. [Again in a sleepy tone.] Why, he--the other one, of course. PROFESSOR RUBEK. The bear-hunter, you mean? MAIA. Yes. There's not a bit of the artist about him--not the least little bit. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Smiling.] No, I believe there's no doubt about that. MAIA. [Vehemently, without moving.] And so ugly as he is! [Plucks up a tuft of heather and throws it away.] So ugly, so ugly! Isch! PROFESSOR RUBEK. Is that why you are so ready to set off with him--out into the wilds? MAIA. [Curtly.] I don't know. [Turning towards him.] You are ugly, too, Rubek. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Have you only just discovered it? MAIA. No, I have seen it for long. PROFESSOR RUBEK. [Shrugging his shoulders.] One doesn't grow younger. One doesn't grow younger, Frau Maia. MAIA. It's not that sort of ugliness that I mean at all. But there has come to be such an expression of fatigue, of utter weariness, in your eyes--when you deign, once in a while, to cast a glance at me. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Have you noticed that? MAIA. [Nods.] Little by little this evil look has come into your eyes. It seems almost as though you were nursing some dark plot against me. PROFESSOR RUBEK. Indeed? [In a friendly but earnest tone.] Come here and sit beside me, Maia; and let us talk a little. MAIA. [Half rising.] Then will you let me sit upon your knee? As I used to in the early days? PROFESSOR RUBEK. No, you mustn't--people can see us from the hotel. [Moves a little.] But you can sit here on the bench--at my side. MAIA. No, thank you; in that case I'd rather lie here, where I am. I can hear
