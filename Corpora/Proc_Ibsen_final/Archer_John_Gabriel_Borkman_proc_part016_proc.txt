 BORKMAN. [Smiling bitterly.] Yes, you are right there. Friendship means--deception. I have learnt that once before. FOLDAL. [Looking at him.] I have no poetic vocation! And you could actually say it to me so bluntly. BORKMAN. [In a gentler tone.] Well, you know, I don't pretend to know much about these matters. FOLDAL. Perhaps you know more than you think. BORKMAN. I? FOLDAL. [Softly.] Yes, you. For I myself have had my doubts, now and then, I may tell you. The horrible doubt that I may have bungled my life for the sake of a delusion. BORKMAN. If you have no faith in yourself, you are on the downward path indeed. FOLDAL. That was why I found such comfort in coming here to lean upon your faith in me. [Taking his hat.] But now you have become a stranger to me. BORKMAN. And you to me. FOLDAL. Good night, John Gabriel. BORKMAN. Good night, Vilhelm. [Foldal goes out to the left. [BORKMAN stands for a moment gazing at the closed door; makes a movement as though to call FOLDAL back, but changes his mind, and begins to pace the floor with his hands behind his back. Then he stops at the table beside the sofa and puts out the lamp. The room becomes half dark. After a short pause, there comes a knock at the tapestry door. BORKMAN. [At the table, starts, turns, and asks in a loud voice:] Who is that knocking? [No answer, another knock. BORKMAN. [Without moving.] Who is it? Come in! [ELLA RENTHEIM, with a lighted candle in her hand, appears in the doorway. She wears her black dress, as before, with her cloak thrown loosely round her shoulders. BORKMAN. [Staring at her.] Who are you? What do you want with me? ELLA RENTHEIM. [Closes the door and advances.] It is I, Borkman. [She puts down the candle on the piano and remains standing beside it. BORKMAN. [Stands as though thunderstruck, stares fixedly at her, and says in a half-whisper.] Is it--is it Ella? Is it Ella Rentheim? ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, it's "your" Ella, as you used to call me in the old days; many, many years ago. BORKMAN. [As before.] Yes, it is you Ella, I can see you now. ELLA RENTHEIM. Can you recognise me? BORKMAN. Yes, now I begin to---- ELLA RENTHEIM. The years have told on me, and brought winter with them, Borkman. Do you not think so? BORKMAN. [In a forced voice.] You are a good deal changed--just at first glance. ELLA RENTHEIM. There are no dark curls on my neck now--the curls you once loved to twist round your fingers. BORKMAN. [Quickly.] True! I can see now, Ella, you have done your hair differently. ELLA RENTHEIM. [With a sad smile.] Precisely; it is the way I do my hair that makes the difference. BORKMAN. [Changing the subject.] I had no idea that you were in this part of the world. ELLA RENTHEIM. I have only just arrived. BORKMAN. Why have you come all this way now, in winter? ELLA RENTHEIM. That you shall hear. BORKMAN. Is it me you have come to see? ELLA RENTHEIM. You among others. But if I am to tell you my errand, I must begin far back. BORKMAN. You look tired. ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, I am tired. BORKMAN. Won't you sit down? There on the sofa. ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, thank you; I need rest. [She crosses to the right and seats herself in the furthest forward corner of the sofa. BORKMAN stands beside the table with his hands behind his back looking at her. A short silence. ELLA RENTHEIM. It seems an endless time since we two met, Borkman, face to face. BORKMAN. [Gloomily.] It is a long, long time. And terrible things have passed since then. ELLA RENTHEIM. A whole lifetime has passed--a wasted lifetime. BORKMAN. [Looking keenly at her.] Wasted! ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, I say wasted--for both of us. BORKMAN. [In a cold business tone.] I cannot regard my life as wasted yet. ELLA RENTHEIM. And what about mine? BORKMAN. There you have yourself to blame, Ella. ELLA RENTHEIM. [With a start.] And you can say that? BORKMAN. You could quite well have been happy without me. ELLA RENTHEIM. Do you believe that? BORKMAN. If you had made up your mind to. ELLA RENTHEIM. [Bitterly.] Oh, yes, I know well enough there was some one else ready to marry me. BORKMAN. But you rejected him. ELLA RENTHEIM. Yes, I did. BORKMAN. Time after time you rejected him. Year after year---- ELLA RENTHEIM. [Scornfully.] Year after year I rejected happiness, I suppose you think? BORKMAN. You might perfectly well have been happy with him. And then I should have been saved. ELLA RENTHEIM. You? BORKMAN. Yes, you would have saved me, Ella. ELLA RENTHEIM. How do you mean? BORKMAN. He thought I was at the bottom of your obstinacy--of your perpetual refusals. And then he took his revenge. It was so easy for him; he had all my frank, confiding letters in his keeping. He made his own use of them; and then it was all over with me--for
