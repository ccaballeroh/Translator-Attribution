 RITA. Is it possible you do not hear it? "The crutch is--floating. The crutch is ------" ALLMERS. [Coming forward.] You shall not stand there listening to a sound that does not exist. I tell You, Asta and Borgheim are on board. They have started already. Asta is gone. RITA. [Looks timidly at him.] Then I suppose you will soon be gone, too, Alfred? ALLMERS. [Quickly.] What do you mean by that? RITA. That you will follow your sister. ALLMERS. Has Asta told you anything? RITA. No. But you said yourself it was for Asta's sake that--that we came together. ALLMERS. Yes, but you, you yourself, have bound me to you--by our life together. RITA. Oh, in your eyes I am not--I am not--entrancingly beautiful any more. ALLMERS. The law of change may perhaps keep us together, none the less. RITA. [Nodding slowly.] There is a change in me now--I feel the anguish of it. ALLMERS. Anguish? RITA. Yes, for change, too, is a sort of birth. ALLMERS. It is--or a resurrection. Transition to a higher life. RITA. [Gazing sadly before her.] Yes--with the loss of all, all life's happiness. ALLMERS. That loss is just the gain. RITA. [Vehemently.] Oh, phrases! Good God, we are creatures of earth after all. ALLMERS. But something akin to the sea and the heavens too, Rita. RITA. You perhaps. Not I. ALLMERS. Oh, yes--you too, more than you yourself suspect. RITA. [Advancing a pace towards him.] Tell me, Alfred--could you think of taking up your work again? ALLMERS. The work that you have hated so? RITA. I am easier to please now. I am willing to share you with the book. ALLMERS. Why? RITA. Only to keep you here with me--to have you near me. ALLMERS. Oh, it is so little I can do to help you, Rita. RITA. But perhaps I could help you. ALLMERS. With my book, do you mean? RITA. No; but to live your life. ALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] I seem to have no life to live. RITA. Well then, to endure your life. ALLMERS. [Darkly, looking away from her.] I think it would be best for both of us that we should part. RITA. [Looking curiously at him.] Then where would you go? Perhaps to Asta, after all? ALLMERS. No--never again to Asta. RITA. Where then? ALLMERS. Up into the solitudes. RITA. Up among the mountains? Is that what you mean? ALLMERS. Yes. RITA. But all that is mere dreaming, Alfred! You could not live up there. ALLMERS. And yet I feel myself drawn to them. RITA. Why? Tell me! ALLMERS. Sit down--and I will tell you something. RITA. Something that happened to you up there? ALLMERS. Yes. RITA. And that you never told Asta and me? ALLMERS. Yes. RITA. Oh, you are so silent about everything. You ought not to be. ALLMERS. Sit down there--and I will tell you about it. RITA. Yes, yes--tell me! [She sits on the bench beside the summer-house.] ALLMERS. I was alone up there, in the heart of the great mountains. I came to a wide, dreary mountain lake; and that lake I had to cross. But I could not--for there was neither a boat nor any one there. RITA. Well? And then? ALLMERS. Then I went without any guidance into a side valley. I thought that by that way I could push on over the heights and between the peaks--and then down again on the other side of the lake. RITA. Oh, and you lost yourself, Alfred! ALLMERS. Yes; I mistook the direction--for there was no path or track. And all day I went on--and all the next night. And at last I thought I should never see the face of man again. RITA. Not come home to us? Oh, then, I am sure your thoughts were with us here. ALLMERS. No--they were not. RITA. Not? ALLMERS. No. It was so strange. Both you and Eyolf seemed to have drifted far, far away from me--and Asta, too. RITA. Then what did you think of? ALLMERS. I did not think. I dragged myself along among the precipices--and revelled in the peace and luxury of death. RITA. [Springing up.] Oh, don't speak in that way of that horror! ALLMERS. I did not feel it so. I had no fear. Here went death and I, it seemed to me, like two good fellow-travellers. It all seemed so natural--so simple, I thought. In my family, we don't live to be old-- RITA. Oh, don't say such things, Alfred! You see you came safely out of it, after all. ALLMERS. Yes; all of a sudden, I found myself where I wanted to be--on the other side of the lake. RITA. It must have been a night of terror for you, Alfred. But now that it is over, you will not admit it to yourself. ALLMERS. That night sealed my resolution. And it was then that I turned about and came straight homewards. To Eyolf. RITA. [Softly.] Too late. ALLMERS. Yes. And then when--my fellow-traveller came and took him--then I felt the horror of it; of it all; of all that, in spite of everything, we dare not tear ourselves away from. So earthbound are we, both of us, Rita. RITA. [With a gleam of joy.] Yes, you are, too, are you not! [Coming close to him.] Oh, let us live our life together as long as we can! ALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] Live our life, yes! And have nothing to fill life with. An empty void on all sides--wherever I look.
