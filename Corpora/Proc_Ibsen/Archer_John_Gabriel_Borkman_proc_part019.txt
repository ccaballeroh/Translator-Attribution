Human beings, animals, plants: I shrank from all--from all but one----

BORKMAN.
  What one?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Erhart, of course.

BORKMAN.
  Erhart?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Erhart--your son, Borkman.

BORKMAN.
  Has he really been so close to your heart?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Why else should I have taken him to me, and kept him as long as
ever I could?  Why?

BORKMAN.
  I thought it was out of pity, like all the rest that you did.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [In strong inward emotion.]  Pity!  Ha, ha!  I have never known
pity, since you deserted me.  I was incapable of feeling it.  If
a poor starved child came into my kitchen, shivering, and crying,
and begging for a morsel of food, I let the servants look to it.
I never felt any desire to take the child to myself, to warm it
at my own hearth, to have the pleasure of seeing it eat and be
satisfied.  And yet I was not like that when I was young; that I
remember clearly!  It is you that have created an empty, barren
desert within me--and without me too!

BORKMAN.
  Except only for Erhart.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, except for your son.  But I am hardened to every other
living thing.  You have cheated me of a mother's joy and happiness
in life--and of a mother's sorrows and tears as well.  And perhaps
that is the heaviest part of the loss to me.

BORKMAN.
  Do you say that, Ella?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Who knows?  It may be that a mother's sorrows and tears were
what I needed most.  [With still deeper emotion.]  But at that
time I could not resign myself to my loss; and that was why I
took Erhart to me.  I won him entirely.  Won his whole, warm,
trustful childish heart--until----  Oh!

BORKMAN.
  Until what?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Until his mother--his mother in the flesh, I mean--took him from
me again.

BORKMAN.
  He had to leave you in any case; he had to come to town.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Wringing her hands.]  Yes, but I cannot bear the solitude--
the emptiness!  I cannot bear the loss of your son's heart!

BORKMAN.
  [With an evil expression in his eyes.]  H'm--I doubt whether
you have lost it, Ella.  Hearts are not so easily lost to a
certain person--in the room below.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I have lost Erhart here, and she has won him back again.  Or
if not she, some one else.  That is plain enough in the letters
he writes me from time to time.

BORKMAN.
  Then it is to take him back with you that you have come here?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, if only it were possible----!

BORKMAN.
  It is possible enough, if you have set your heart upon it.  For
you have the first and strongest claims upon him.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh, claims, claims!  What is the use of claims?  If he is not
mine of his own free will, he is not mine at all.  And have him
I must!  I must have my boy's heart, whole and undivided--now!

BORKMAN.
  You must remember that Erhart is well into his twenties.  You
could scarcely reckon on keeping his heart very long undivided,
as you express it.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [With a melancholy smile.]  It would not need to be for so very
long.

BORKMAN.
  Indeed?  I should have thought that when you want a thing, you
want it to the end of your days.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  So I do.  But that need not mean for very long.

BORKMAN.
  [Taken aback.]  What do you mean by that?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I suppose you know I have been in bad health for many years past?

BORKMAN.
  Have you?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Do you not know that?

BORKMAN.
  No, I cannot say I did----

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looking at him in surprise.]  Has Erhart not told you so?

BORKMAN.
  I really don't remember at the moment.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Perhaps he has not spoken of me at all?

BORKMAN.
  Oh, yes, I believe he has spoken of you.  But the fact is, I
so seldom see anything of him--scarcely ever.  There is a certain
person below that keeps him away from me.  Keeps him away, you
understand?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Are you quite sure of that, Borkman?

BORKMAN.
  Yes, absolutely sure.  [Changing his tone.]  And so you have
been in bad health, Ella?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, I have.  And this autumn I grew so much worse that I had
to come to town and take better medical advice.

BORKMAN.
  And you have seen the doctors already?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, this morning.

BORKMAN.
  And what did they say to you?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  They gave me full assurance of what I had long suspected.

BORKMAN.
  Well?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Calmly and quietly.]  My illness will never be cured, Borkman.

BORKMAN.
  Oh, you must not believe that, Ella.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  It is a disease that there is no help or cure for.  The doctors
can do nothing with it.  They must just let it take its course.
They cannot possibly check it; at most, they can allay the
suffering.  And that is always something.

BORKMAN.
  Oh, but it will take a long time to run its course.  I am sure
it will.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I may perhaps last out the winter, they told me.

BORKMAN.
  [Without thinking.]  Oh, well, the winter is long.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Quietly.]  Long enough for me, at any rate.

BORKMAN.
  [Eagerly, changing the subject.]  But what in all the world can
