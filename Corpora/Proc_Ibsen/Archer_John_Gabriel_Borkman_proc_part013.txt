  [With a stern glance.]  I must say you are rather a late visitor.

FOLDAL.
  Well, you know, it's a good bit of a way, especially when you
have to trudge it on foot.

BORKMAN.
  But why do you always walk, Vilhelm?  The tramway passes your
door.

FOLDAL.
  It's better for you to walk--and then you always save twopence.
Well, has Frida been playing to you lately?

BORKMAN.
  She has just this moment gone.  Did you not meet her outside?

FOLDAL.
  No, I have seen nothing of her for a long time; not since she
went to live with this Mrs. Wilton.

BORKMAN.
  [Seating himself on the sofa and waving his hand toward a chair.]
You may sit down, Vilhelm.

FOLDAL.
  [Seating himself on the edge of a chair.]  Many thanks.  [Looks
mournfully at him.]  You can't think how lonely I feel since Frida
left home.

BORKMAN.
  Oh, come--you have plenty left.

FOLDAL.
  Yes, God knows I have--five of them.  But Frida was the only one
who at all understood me.  [Shaking his head sadly.]  The others
don't understand me a bit.

BORKMAN.
  [Gloomily, gazing straight before him, and drumming on the
table with his fingers.]  No, that's just it.  That is the curse
we exceptional, chosen people have to bear.  The common herd--
the average man and woman--they do not understand us, Vilhelm.

FOLDAL.
  [With resignation.]  If it were only the lack of understanding--
with a little patience, one could manage to wait for that awhile
yet.  [His voice choked with tears.]  But there is something
still bitterer.

BORKMAN.
  [Vehemently.]  There is nothing bitterer than that.

FOLDAL.
  Yes, there is, John Gabriel.  I have gone through a domestic
scene to-night--just before I started.

BORKMAN.
  Indeed?  What about?

FOLDAL.
  [With an outburst.]  My people at home--they despise me.

BORKMAN.
  [Indignantly.]  Despise----?

FOLDAL.
  [Wiping his eyes.]  I have long known it; but to-day it came
out unmistakably.

BORKMAN.
  [After a short silence.]  You made an unwise choice, I fear,
when you married.

FOLDAL.
  I had practically no choice in the matter.  And, you see, one
feels a need for companionship as one begins to get on in years.
And so crushed as I then was--so utterly broken down----

BORKMAN.
  [Jumping up in anger.]  Is this meant for me?  A reproach----!

FOLDAL.
  [Alarmed.]  No, no, for Heaven's sake, John Gabriel----!

BORKMAN.
  Yes, you are thinking of the disaster to the bank, I can see
you are.

FOLDAL.
  [Soothingly.]  But I don't blame you for that!  Heaven forbid!

BORKMAN.
  [Growling, resumes his seat.]  Well, that is a good thing, at
any rate.

FOLDAL.
  Besides, you mustn't think it is my wife that I complain of.  It
is true she has not much polish, poor thing; but she is a good sort
of woman all the same.  No, it's the children.

BORKMAN.
  I thought as much.

FOLDAL.
  For the children--well, they have more culture and therefore
they expect more of life.

BORKMAN.
  [Looking at him sympathetically.]  And so your children despise
you, Vilhelm?

FOLDAL.
  [Shrugging his shoulders.]  I haven't made much of a career,
you see--there is no denying that.

BORKMAN.
  [Moving nearer to him, and laying his hand upon his arm.]  Do
they not know, then, that in your young days you wrote a tragedy?

FOLDAL.
  Yes, of course they know that.  But it doesn't seem to make much
impression on them.

BORKMAN.
  Then they don't understand these things.  For your tragedy is
good.  I am firmly convinced of that.

FOLDAL.
  [Brightening up.]  Yes, don't you think there are some good
things in it, John Gabriel?  Good God, if I could only manage
to get it placed----!  [Opens his portfolio, and begins eagerly
turning over the contents.]  Look here!  Just let me show you
one or two alterations I have made.

BORKMAN.
  Have you it with you?

FOLDAL.
  Yes, I thought I would bring it.  It's so long now since I have
read it to you.  And I thought perhaps it might amuse you to hear
an act or two.

BORKMAN.
  [Rising, with a negative gesture.]  No, no, we will keep that
for another time.

FOLDAL.
  Well, well, as you please.

    [BORKMAN paces up and down the room.  FOLDAL puts the
        manuscript up again.

BORKMAN.
  [Stopping in front of him.]  You are quite right in what you
said just now--you have not made any career.  But I promise you
this, Vilhelm, that when once the hour of my restoration strikes----

FOLDAL.
  [Making a movement to rise.]  Oh, thanks, thanks!

BORKMAN.
  [Waving his hand.]  No, please be seated.  [With rising
excitement.]  When the hour of my restoration strikes--when they
see that they cannot get on without me--when they come to me, here
in the gallery, and crawl to my feet, and beseech me to take the
reins of the bank again----!  The new bank, that they have founded
and can't carry on----  [Placing himself beside the writing-table
in the same attitude as before, and striking his breast.]  Here
I shall stand, and receive them!  And it shall be known far and
wide, all the country over, what conditions John Gabriel Borkman
