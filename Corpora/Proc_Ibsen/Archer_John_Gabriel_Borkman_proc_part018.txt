when the crash came----

BORKMAN.
  [Eagerly.]  What then, Ella?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Trust me, I should have borne it all so gladly along with you.
The shame, the ruin--I would have helped you to bear it all--all!

BORKMAN.
  Would you have had the will--the strength?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Both the will and the strength.  For then I did not know of
your great, your terrible crime.

BORKMAN.
  What crime?  What are you speaking of?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I am speaking of that crime for which there is no forgiveness.

BORKMAN.
  [Staring at her.]  You must be out of your mind.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Approaching him.]  You are a murderer!  You have committed the
one mortal sin!

BORKMAN.
  [Falling back towards the piano.]  You are raving, Ella!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  You have killed the love-life in me.  [Still nearer him.]  Do
you understand what that means?  The Bible speaks of a mysterious
sin for which there is no forgiveness.  I have never understood
what it could be; but now I understand.  The great, unpardonable
sin is to murder the love-life in a human soul.

BORKMAN.
  And you say I have done that?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  You have done that.  I have never rightly understood until
this evening what had really happened to me.  That you deserted
me and turned to Gunhild instead--I took that to be mere common
fickleness on your part, and the result of heartless scheming
on hers.  I almost think I despised you a little, in spite of
everything.  But now I see it!  You deserted the woman you loved!
Me, me, me!  What you held dearest in the world you were ready to
barter away for gain.  That is the double murder you have
committed!  The murder of your own soul and of mine!

BORKMAN.
  [With cold self-control.]  How well I recognise your passionate,
ungovernable spirit, Ella.  No doubt it is natural enough that
you should look at the thing in this light.  Of course, you are
a woman, and therefore it would seem that your own heart is the
one thing you know or care about in this world.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, yes it is.

BORKMAN.
  Your own heart is the only thing that exists for you.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  The only thing!  The only thing!  You are right there.

BORKMAN.
  But you must remember that I am a man.  As a woman, you were the
dearest thing in the world to me.  But if the worst comes to the
worst, one woman can always take the place of another.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looks at him with a smile.]  Was that your experience when you
had made Gunhild your wife?

BORKMAN.
  No.  But the great aims I had in life helped me to bear even
that.  I wanted to have at my command all the sources of power
in this country.  All the wealth that lay hidden in the soil,
and the rocks, and the forests, and the sea--  I wanted to gather
it all into my hands to make myself master of it all, and so to
promote the well-being of many, many thousands.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Lost in recollection.]  I know it.  Think of all the evenings
we spent in talking over your projects.

BORKMAN.
  Yes, I could talk to you, Ella.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I jested with your plans, and asked whether you wanted to awaken
all the sleeping spirits of the mine.

BORKMAN.
  [Nodding.]  I remember that phrase.  [Slowly.]  All the sleeping
spirits of the mine.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  But you did not take it as a jest.  You said: "Yes, yes, Ella,
that is just what I want to do."

BORKMAN.
  And so it was.  If only I could get my foot in the stirrup----
And that depended on that one man.  He could and would secure me
the control of the bank--if I on my side----

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, just so!  If you on your side would renounce the woman you
loved--and who loved you beyond words in return.

BORKMAN.
  I knew his consuming passion for you.  I knew that on no other
condition would he----

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  And so you struck the bargain.

BORKMAN.
  [Vehemently.]  Yes, I did, Ella!  For the love of power is
uncontrollable in me, you see!  So I struck the bargain; I had to.
And he helped me half-way up towards the beckoning heights that I
was bent on reaching.  And I mounted and mounted; year by year
I mounted----

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  And I was as though wiped out of your life.

BORKMAN.
  And after all he hurled me into the abyss again.  On account of
you, Ella.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [After a short thoughtful silence.]  Borkman, does it not seem
to you as if there had been a sort of curse on our whole relation?

BORKMAN.
  [Looking at her.]  A curse?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes.  Don't you think so?

BORKMAN.
  [Uneasily.]  Yes. But why is it?  [With an outburst.]  Oh Ella,
I begin to wonder which is in the right--you or I!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  It is you who have sinned.  You have done to death all the
gladness of my life in me.

BORKMAN.
  [Anxiously.]  Do not say that, Ella!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  All a woman's gladness at any rate.  From the day when your image
began to dwindle in my mind, I have lived my life as though under
an eclipse.  During all these years it has grown harder and harder
for me--and at last utterly impossible--to love any living creature.
