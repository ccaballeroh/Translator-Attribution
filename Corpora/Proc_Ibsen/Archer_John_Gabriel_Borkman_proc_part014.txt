imposes before he will----  [Stopping suddenly and staring at
FOLDAL.]  You're looking so doubtfully at me!  Perhaps you do not
believe that they will come?  That they must, must, must come to
me some day?  Do you not believe it?

FOLDAL.
  Yes, Heaven knows I do, John Gabriel.

BORKMAN.
  [Seating himself again on the sofa.]  I firmly believe it.  I
am immovably convinced--I know that they will come.  If I had not
been certain of that I would have put a bullet through my head
long ago.

FOLDAL.
  [Anxiously.]  Oh no, for Heaven's sake----!

BORKMAN.
  [Exultantly.]  But they will come!  They will come sure enough!
You shall see!  I expect them any day, any moment.  And you see,
I hold myself in readiness to receive them.

FOLDAL.
  [With a sigh.]  If only they would come quickly.

BORKMAN.
  [Restlessly.]  Yes, time flies: the years slip away; life----
Ah, no--I dare not think of it!  [Looking at him.]  Do you know
what I sometimes feel like?

FOLDAL.
  What?

BORKMAN.
  I feel like a Napoleon who has been maimed in his first battle.

FOLDAL.
  [Placing his hand upon his portfolio.]  I have that feeling too.

BORKMAN.
  Oh, well, that is on a smaller scale, of course.

FOLDAL.
  [Quietly.]  My little world of poetry is very precious to me,
John Gabriel.

BORKMAN.
  [Vehemently.]  Yes, but think of me, who could have created
millions!  All the mines I should have controlled!  New veins
innumerable!  And the water-falls!  And the quarries!  And the
trade routes, and the steamship-lines all the wide world over!
I would have organised it all--I alone!

FOLDAL.
  Yes, I know, I know.  There was nothing in the world you would
have shrunk from.

BORKMAN.
  [Clenching his hands together.]  And now I have to sit here,
like a wounded eagle, and look on while others pass me in the
race, and take everything away from me, piece by piece!

FOLDAL.
  That is my fate too.

BORKMAN.
  [Not noticing him.]  Only to think of it; so near to the goal
as I was!  If I had only had another week to look about me!  All
the deposits would have been covered.  All the securities I had
dealt with so daringly should have been in their places again as
before.  Vast companies were within a hair's-breadth of being
floated.  Not a soul should have lost a half-penny.

FOLDAL.
  Yes, yes; you were on the very verge of success.

BORKMAN.
  [With suppressed fury.]  And then treachery overtook me!  Just
at the critical moment!  [Looking at him.]  Do you know what I
hold to be the most infamous crime a man can be guilty of?

FOLDAL.
  No, tell me.

BORKMAN.
  It is not murder.  It is not robbery or house-breaking.  It is
not even perjury.  For all these things people do to those they
hate, or who are indifferent to them, and do not matter.

FOLDAL.
  What is the worst of all then, John Gabriel?

BORKMAN.
  [With emphasis.]  The most infamous of crimes is a friend's
betrayal of his friend's confidence.

FOLDAL.
  [Somewhat doubtfully.]  Yes, but you know----

BORKMAN.
  [Firing up.]  What are you going to say?  I see it in your face.
But it is of no use.  The people who had their securities in the
bank should have got them all back again--every farthing.  No; I
tell you the most infamous crime a man can commit is to misuse a
friend's letters; to publish to all the world what has been
confided to him alone, in the closest secrecy, like a whisper
in an empty, dark, double-locked room.  The man who can do such
things is infected and poisoned in every fibre with the morals
of the higher rascality.  And such a friend was mine--and it
was he who crushed me.

FOLDAL.
  I can guess whom you mean.

BORKMAN.
  There was not a nook or cranny of my life that I hesitated
to lay open to him.  And then, when the moment came, he turned
against me the weapons I myself had placed in his hands.

FOLDAL.
  I have never been able to understand why he----  Of course,
there were whispers of all sorts at the time.

BORKMAN.
  What were the whispers?  Tell me.  You see I know nothing.
For I had to go straight into--into isolation.  What did people
whisper, Vilhelm?

FOLDAL.
  You were to have gone into the Cabinet, they said.

BORKMAN.
  I was offered a portfolio, but I refused it.

FOLDAL.
  Then it wasn't there you stood in his way?

BORKMAN.
  Oh, no; that was not the reason he betrayed me.

FOLDAL.
  Then I really can't understand----

BORKMAN.
  I may as well tell you, Vilhelm----

FOLDAL.
  Well?

BORKMAN.
  There was--in fact, there was a woman in the case.

FOLDAL.
  A woman in the case?  Well but, John Gabriel----

BORKMAN.
  [Interrupting.]  Well, well--let us say no more of these stupid
old stories.  After all, neither of us got into the Cabinet,
neither he nor I.

FOLDAL.
  But he rose high in the world.

BORKMAN.
  And I fell into the abyss.

FOLDAL.
  Oh, it's a terrible tragedy----

BORKMAN.
  [Nodding to him.]  Almost as terrible as yours, I fancy, when
I come to think of it.

FOLDAL.
  [Naively.]  Yes, at least as terrible.

BORKMAN.
  [Laughing quietly.]  But looked at from another point of view,
