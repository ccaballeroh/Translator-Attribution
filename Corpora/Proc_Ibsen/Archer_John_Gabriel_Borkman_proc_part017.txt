the time, that is to say.  So you see it is all your doing, Ella!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh indeed, Borkman.  If we look into the matter, it appears that
it is I who owe you reparation.

BORKMAN.
  It depends how you look at it.  I know quite well all that you
have done for us.  You bought in this house, and the whole
property, at the auction.  You placed the house entirely at my
disposal--and your sister too.  You took charge of Erhart, and
cared for him in every way----

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  As long as I was allowed to----

BORKMAN.
  By your sister, you mean.  I have never mixed myself up in these
domestic affairs.  As I was saying, I know all the sacrifices you
have made for me and for your sister.  But you were in a position
to do so, Ella; and you must not forget that it was I who placed
you in that position.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Indignantly.]  There you make a great mistake, Borkman!  It was
the love of my inmost heart for Erhart--and for you too--that made
me do it!

BORKMAN.
  [Interrupting.]  My dear Ella, do not let us get upon questions
of sentiment and that sort of thing.  I mean, of course, that if
you acted generously, it was I that put it in your power to do so.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Smiling.]  H'm!  In my power----

BORKMAN.
  [Warmly.]  Yes, put it in your power, I say!  On the eve of the
great decisive battle--when I could not afford to spare either kith
or kin--when I had to grasp at--when I did grasp at the millions
that were entrusted to me--then I spared all that was yours, every
farthing, although I could have taken it, and made use of it, as
I did of all the rest!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Coldly and quietly.]  That is quite true, Borkman.

BORKMAN.
  Yes it is.  And that was why, when they came and took me, they
found all your securities untouched in the strong-room of the bank.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looking at him.]  I have often and often wondered what was your
real reason for sparing all my property?  That, and that alone.

BORKMAN.
  My reason?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, your reason.  Tell me.

BORKMAN.
  [Harshly and scornfully.]  Perhaps you think it was that I might
have something to fall back upon, if things went wrong?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh no, I am sure you did not think of that in those days.

BORKMAN.
  Never!  I was so absolutely certain of victory.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Well then, why was it that----?

BORKMAN.
  [Shrugging his shoulders.]  Upon my soul, Ella, it is not so
easy to remember one's motives of twenty years ago.  I only know
that when I used to grapple, silently and alone, with all the
great projects I had in my mind, I had something like the feeling
of a man who is starting on a balloon voyage.  All through my
sleepless nights I was inflating my giant balloon, and preparing
to soar away into perilous, unknown regions.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Smiling.]  You, who never had the least doubt of victory?

BORKMAN.
  [Impatiently.]  Men are made so, Ella.  They both doubt and
believe at the same time.  [Looking straight before him.]  And
I suppose that was why I would not take you and yours with me
in the balloon.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Eagerly.]  Why, I ask you?  Tell me why!

BORKMAN.
  [Without looking at her.]  One shrinks from risking what one
holds dearest on such a voyage.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  You had risked what was dearest to you on that voyage.  Your
whole future life----

BORKMAN.
  Life is not always what one holds dearest.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Breathlessly.]  Was that how you felt at that time?

BORKMAN.
  I fancy it was.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I was the dearest thing in the world to you?

BORKMAN.
  I seem to remember something of the sort.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  And yet years had passed since you had deserted me--and married--
married another!

BORKMAN.
  Deserted you, you say?  You must know very well that it was
higher motives--well then, other motives that compelled me.
Without his support I could not have done anything.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Controlling herself.]  So you deserted me from--higher motives.

BORKMAN.
  I could not get on without his help.  And he made you the price
of helping me.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  And you paid the price.  Paid it in full--without haggling.

BORKMAN.
  I had no choice.  I had to conquer or fall.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [In a trembling voice, looking at him.]  Can what you tell me
be true--that I was then the dearest thing in the world to you?

BORKMAN.
  Both then and afterwards--long, long, after.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  But you bartered me away none the less; drove a bargain with
another man for your love.  Sold my love for a--for a directorship.

BORKMAN.
  [Gloomily and bowed down.]  I was driven by inexorable
necessity, Ella.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Rises from the sofa, quivering with passion.]  Criminal!

BORKMAN.
  [Starts, but controls himself.]  I have heard that word before.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh, don't imagine I'm thinking of anything you may have done
against the law of the land!  The use you made of all those
vouchers and securities, or whatever you call them--do you think
I care a straw about that!  If I could have stood at your side
