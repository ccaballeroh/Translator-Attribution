the sin towards me!  [Looking triumphantly at them both.]  But he
will not obey you!  When I cry out to him in my need, he will come
to me!  It is with me that he will remain!  With me, and never
with any one else.  [Suddenly listens, and cries.]  I hear him!
He is here, he is here!  Erhart!

    [ERHART BORKMAN hastily tears open the hall door, and enters
        the room.  He is wearing an overcoat and has his hat on.

ERHART.
  [Pale and anxious.]  Mother!  What in Heaven's name----!  [Seeing
BORKMAN, who is standing beside the doorway leading into the
garden-room, he starts and takes off his hat.  After a moment's
silence, he asks:]  What do you want with me, mother?  What has
happened?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Stretching her arms towards him.]  I want to see you, Erhart!
I want to have you with me, always!

ERHART.
  [Stammering.]  Have me----?  Always?  What do you mean by that?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  I will have you, I say!  There is some one who wants to take
you away from me!

ERHART.
  [Recoiling a step.]  Ah--so you know?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes.  Do you know it, too?

ERHART.
  [Surprised, looking at her.]  Do _I_ know it?  Yes, of course.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Aha, so you have planned it all out!  Behind my back!  Erhart!
Erhart!

ERHART.
  [Quickly.]  Mother, tell me what it is you know!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  I know everything.  I know that your aunt has come here to take
you from me.

ERHART.
  Aunt Ella!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh, listen to me a moment, Erhart!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Continuing.]  She wants me to give you up to her.  She wants
to stand in your mother's place to you, Erhart!  She wants you
to be her son, and not mine, from this time forward.  She wants
you to inherit everything from her; to renounce your own name
and take hers instead!

ERHART.
  Aunt Ella, is this true?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, it is true.

ERHART.
  I knew nothing of this.  Why do you want to have me with you
again?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Because I feel that I am losing you here.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Hardly.]  You are losing him to me--yes.  And that is just as
it should be.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looking beseechingly at him.]  Erhart, I cannot afford to lose
you.  For, I must tell you I am a lonely--dying woman.

ERHART.
  Dying----?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, dying.  Will you came and be with me to the end?  Attach
yourself wholly to me?  Be to me, as though you were my own
child----?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Interrupting.]  And forsake your mother, and perhaps your
mission in life as well?  Will you, Erhart?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I am condemned to death.  Answer me, Erhart.

ERHART.
  [Warmly, with emotion.]  Aunt Ella, you have been unspeakably
good to me.  With you I grew up in as perfect happiness as any
boy can ever have known----

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Erhart, Erhart!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh, how glad I am that you can still say that!

ERHART.
  But I cannot sacrifice myself to you now.  It is not possible
for me to devote myself wholly to taking a son's place towards you.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Triumphing.]  Ah, I knew it!  You shall not have him!  You shall
not have him, Ella!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Sadly.]  I see it.  You have won him back.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, yes!  Mine he is, and mine he shall remain!  Erhart, say
it is so, dear; we two have still a long way to go together, have
we not?

ERHART.
  [Struggling with himself.]  Mother, I may as well tell you
plainly----

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Eagerly.]  What?

ERHART.
  I am afraid it is only a very little way you and I can go
together.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Stands as though thunderstruck.]  What do you mean by that?

ERHART.
  [Plucking up spirit.]  Good heavens, mother, I am young, after
all!  I feel as if the close air of this room must stifle me in
the end.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Close air?  Here--with me?

ERHART.
  Yes, here with you, mother.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Then come with me, Erhart.

ERHART.
  Oh, Aunt Ella, it's not a whit better with you.  It's different,
but no better--no better for me.  It smells of rose-leaves and
lavender there too; it is as airless there as here.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Shaken, but having recovered her composure with an effort.]
Airless in your mother's room, you say!

ERHART.
  [In growing impatience.]  Yes, I don't know how else to express
it.  All this morbid watchfulness and--and idolisation, or whatever
you like to call it----  I can't endure it any longer!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looking at him with deep solemnity.]  Have you forgotten what
you have consecrated your life to, Erhart?

ERHART.
  [With an outburst.]  Oh, say rather what you have consecrated
my life to.  You, you have been my will.  You have never given
me leave to have any of my own.  But now I cannot bear this yoke
any longer.  I am young; remember that, mother.  [With a polite,
considerate glance towards BORKMAN.]  I cannot consecrate my life
to making atonement for another--whoever that other may be.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Seized with growing anxiety.]  Who is it that has transformed
you, Erhart?

ERHART.
  [Struck.]  Who?  Can you not conceive that it is I myself?
