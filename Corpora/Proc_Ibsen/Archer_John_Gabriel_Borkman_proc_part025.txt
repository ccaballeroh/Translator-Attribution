MRS. BORKMAN.
  You have not, say you!

MRS. WILTON.
  No.  I have neither cajoled nor deluded him.  Erhart came to me
of his own free will.  And of my own free will I went out half-way
to meet him.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Measuring her scornfully with her eye.]  Yes, indeed!  That I
can easily believe.

MRS. WILTON.
  [With self-control.]  Mrs. Borkman, there are forces in human
life that you seem to know very little about.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  What forces, may I ask?

MRS. WILTON.
  The forces which ordain that two people shall join their lives
together, indissolubly--and fearlessly.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With a smile.]  I thought you were already indissolubly bound--
to another.

MRS. WILTON.
  [Shortly.]  That other has deserted me.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  But he is still living, they say.

MRS. WILTON.
  He is dead to me.

ERHART.
  [Insistently.]  Yes, mother, he is dead to Fanny.  And besides,
this other makes no difference to me!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looking sternly at him.]  So you know all this--about the other.

ERHART.
  Yes, mother, I know quite well--all about it!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  And yet you can say that it makes no difference to you?

ERHART.
  [With defiant petulance.]  I can only tell you that it is
happiness I must have!  I am young!  I want to live, live, live!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, you are young, Erhart.  Too young for this.

MRS. WILTON.
  [Firmly and earnestly.]  You must not think, Mrs. Borkman,
that I haven't said the same to him.  I have laid my whole life
before him.  Again and again I have reminded him that I am seven
years older than he----

ERHART.
  [Interrupting.]  Oh, nonsense, Fanny--I knew that all the time.

MRS. WILTON.
  But nothing--nothing was of any use.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Indeed?  Nothing?  Then why did you not dismiss him without
more ado?  Close your door to him?  You should have done that,
and done it in time!

MRS. WILTON.
  [Looks at her, and says in a low voice.]  I could not do that,
Mrs. Borkman.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Why could you not?

MRS. WILTON.
  Because for me too this meant happiness.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Scornfully.]  H'm, happiness, happiness----

MRS. WILTON.
  I have never before known happiness in life.  And I cannot
possibly drive happiness away from me, merely because it comes
so late.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  And how long do you think this happiness will last?

ERHART.
  [Interrupting.]  Whether it lasts or does not last, mother,
it doesn't matter now!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [In anger.]  Blind boy that you are!  Do you not see where all
this is leading you?

ERHART.
  I don't want to look into the future.  I don't want to look
around me in any direction; I am only determined to live my own
life--at last!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With deep pain.]  And you call this life, Erhart!

ERHART.
  Don't you see how lovely she is!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Wringing her hands.]  And I have to bear this load of shame
as well!

BORKMAN.
  [At the back, harshly and cuttingly.]  Ho--you are used to
bearing things of that sort, Gunhild!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Imploringly.]  Borkman!

ERHART.
  [Similarly.]  Father!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Day after day I shall have to see my own son linked to a--a----

ERHART.
  [Interrupting her harshly.]  You shall see nothing of the kind,
mother!  You may make your mind easy on that point.  I shall not
remain here.

MRS. WILTON.
  [Quickly and with decision.]  We are going away, Mrs. Borkman.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Turning pale.]  Are you going away, too?  Together, no doubt?

MRS. WILTON.
  [Nodding.]  Yes, I am going abroad, to the south.  I am taking
a young girl with me.  And Erhart is going along with us.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  With you--and a young girl?

MRS. WILTON.
  Yes.  It is little Frida Foldal, whom I have had living with me.
I want her to go abroad and get more instruction in music.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  So you are taking her with you?

MRS. WILTON.
  Yes; I can't well send her out into the world alone.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Suppressing a smile.]  What do you say to this, Erhart?

ERHART.
  [With some embarrassment, shrugging his shoulders.]  Well,
mother, since Fanny will have it so----

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Coldly.]  And when does this distinguished party set out, if
one may ask?

MRS. WILTON.
  We are going at once--to-night.  My covered sledge is waiting
on the road, outside the Hinkels'.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looking her from head to foot.]  Aha! so that was what the
party meant?

MRS. WILTON.
  [Smiling.]  Yes, Erhart and I were the whole party.  And little
Frida, of course.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  And where is she now?

MRS. WILTON.
  She is sitting in the sledge waiting for us.

ERHART.
  [In painful embarrassment.]  Mother, surely you can understand?
I would have spared you all this--you and every one.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looks at him, deeply pained.]  You would have gone away from
me without saying a good-bye?

ERHART.
  Yes, I thought that would be best; best for all of us.  Our
boxes were packed and everything settled.  But of course
when you sent for me, I----  [Holding out his hands to her.]
Good-bye, mother.
