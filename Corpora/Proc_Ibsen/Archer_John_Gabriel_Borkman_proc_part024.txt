MRS. BORKMAN.
  No, no, no!  You have come under some strange power.  You
are not in your mother's power any longer; nor in your--your
foster-mother's either.

ERHART.
  [With laboured defiance.]  I am in my own power, mother!  And
working my own will!

BORKMAN.
  [Advancing towards ERHART.]  Then perhaps my hour has come at
last.

ERHART.
  [Distantly and with measured politeness.]  How so!  How do you
mean, sir?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Scornfully.]  Yes, you may well ask that.

BORKMAN.
  [Continuing undisturbed.]  Listen, Erhart--will you not cast in
your lot with your father?  It is not through any other man's life
that a man who has fallen can be raised up again.  These are only
empty fables that have been told to you down here in the airless
room.  If you were to set yourself to live your life like all the
saints together, it would be of no use whatever to me.

ERHART.
  [With measured respectfulness.]  That is very true indeed.

BORKMAN.
  Yes, it is.  And it would be of no use either if I should resign
myself to wither away in abject penitence.  I have tried to feed
myself upon hopes and dreams, all through these years.  But I am
not the man to be content with that; and now I mean to have done
with dreaming.

ERHART.
  [With a slight bow.]  And what will--what will you do, sir?

BORKMAN.
  I will work out my own redemption, that is what I will do.  I
will begin at the bottom again.  It is only through his present
and his future that a man can atone for his past.  Through work,
indefatigable work, for all that, in my youth, seemed to give life
its meaning--and that now seems a thousand times greater than it
did then.  Erhart, will you join with me and help me in this new
life?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Raising her hand warningly.]  Do not do it, Erhart!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Warmly.]  Yes, yes do it!  Oh, help him, Erhart!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  And you advise him to do that?  You, the lonely dying woman.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I don't care about myself.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  No, so long as it is not I that take him from you.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Precisely so, Gunhild.

BORKMAN.
  Will you, Erhart?

ERHART.
  [Wrung with pain.]  Father, I cannot now.  It is utterly
impossible!

BORKMAN.
  What do you want to do then?

ERHART.
  [With a sudden glow.]  I am young!  I want to live, for once
in a way, as well as other people!  I want to live my own life!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  You cannot give up two or three little months to brighten the
close of a poor waning life?

ERHART.
  I cannot, Aunt, however much I may wish to.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Not for the sake of one who loves you so dearly?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looking sharply at him.]  And your mother has no power over
you either, any more?

ERHART.
  I will always love you, mother; but I cannot go on living for
you alone.  This is no life for me.

BORKMAN.
  Then come and join with me, after all!  For life, life means
work, Erhart.  Come, we two will go forth into life and work
together!

ERHART.
  [Passionately.]  Yes, but I don't want to work now!  For I am
young!  That's what I never realised before; but now the knowledge
is tingling through every vein in my body.  I will not work!  I
will only live, live, live!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With a cry of divination.]  Erhart, what will you live for?

ERHART.
  [With sparkling eyes.]  For happiness, mother!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  And where do you think you can find that?

ERHART.
  I have found it, already!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Shrieks.]  Erhart!  [ERHART goes quickly to the hall door and
throws it open.]

ERHART.
  [Calls out.]  Fanny, you can come in now!

    [MRS. WILTON, in outdoor wraps, appears on the threshold.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With uplifted hands.]  Mrs. Wilton!

MRS. WILTON.
  [Hesitating a little, with an enquiring glance at ERHART.]  Do you
want me to----?

ERHART.
  Yes, now you can come in.  I have told them everything.

    [MRS. WILTON comes forward into the room.  ERHART closes the
        door behind her.  She bows formally to BORKMAN, who returns
        her bow in silence.  A short pause.

MRS. WILTON.
  [In a subdued but firm voice.]  So the word has been spoken--
and I suppose you all think I have brought a great calamity upon
this house?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Slowly, looking hard at her.]  You have crushed the last
remnant of interest in life for me.  [With an outburst.]  But
all of this--all this is utterly impossible!

MRS. WILTON.
  I can quite understand that it must appear impossible to you,
Mrs. Borkman.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, you can surely see for yourself that it is impossible.
Or what----?

MRS. WILTON.
  I should rather say that it seems highly improbable.  But it's
so, none the less.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Turning.]  Are you really in earnest about this, Erhart?

ERHART.
  This means happiness for me, mother--all the beauty and
happiness of life.  That is all I can say to you.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Clenching her hands together; to MRS. WILTON.]  Oh, how you
have cajoled and deluded my unhappy son!

MRS. WILTON.
  [Raising her head proudly.]  I have done nothing of the sort.
