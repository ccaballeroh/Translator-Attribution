have brought on this illness?  You, who have always lived such a
healthy and regular life?  What can have brought it on?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looking at him.]  The doctors thought that perhaps at one time
in my life I had had to go through some great stress of emotion.

BORKMAN.
  [Firing up.]  Emotion!  Aha, I understand!  You mean that it is
my fault?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [With increasing inward agitation.]  It is too late to go into
that matter now!  But I must have my heart's own child again before
I go!  It is so unspeakably sad for me to think that I must go
away from all that is called life--away from sun, and light, and
air--and not leave behind me one single human being who will think
of me--who will remember me lovingly and mournfully--as a son
remembers and thinks of the mother he has lost.

BORKMAN.
  [After a short pause.]  Take him, Ella, if you can win him.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [With animation.]  Do you give your consent?  Can you?

BORKMAN.
  [Gloomily.]  Yes.  And it is no great sacrifice either.  For in
any case he is not mine.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Thank you, thank you all the same for the sacrifice!  But I have
one thing more to beg of you--a great thing for me, Borkman.

BORKMAN.
  Well, what is it?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I daresay you will think it childish of me--you will not
understand----

BORKMAN.
  Go on--tell me what it is.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  When I die--as I must soon--I shall have a fair amount to leave
behind me.

BORKMAN.
  Yes, I suppose so.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  And I intend to leave it all to Erhart.

BORKMAN.
  Well, you have really no one nearer to you than he.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Warmly.]  No, indeed, I have no one nearer me than he.

BORKMAN.
  No one of your own family.  You are the last.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Nodding slowly.]  Yes, that is just it.  When I die, the name
of Rentheim dies with me.  And that is such a torturing thought
to me.  To be wiped out of existence--even to your very name----

BORKMAN.
  [Firing up.]  Ah, I see what you are driving at!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Passionately.]  Do not let this be my forte.  Let Erhart bear
my name after me!

BORKMAN.
  I understand you well enough.  You want to save my son from
having to bear his father's name.  That is your meaning.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  No, no, not that!  I myself would have borne it proudly and
gladly along with you!  But a mother who is at the point of
death----  There is more binding force in a name than you think
or believe, Borkman.

BORKMAN.
  [Coldly and proudly.]  Well and good, Ella.  I am man enough
to bear my own name alone.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Seizing and pressing his hand.]  Thank you, thank you!  Now
there has been a full settlement between us!  Yes, yes, let it
be so!  You have made all the atonement in your power.  For when
I have gone from the world, I shall leave Erhart Rentheim behind
me!

    [The tapestry door is thrown open.  MRS. BORKMAN, with the
        large shawl over her head, stands in the doorway.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [In violent agitation.]  Never to his dying day shall Erhart
be called by that name!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Shrinking back.]  Gunhild!

BORKMAN.
  [Harshly and threateningly.]  I allow no one to come up to my
room!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Advancing a step.]  I do not ask your permission.

BORKMAN.
  [Going towards her.]  What do you want with me?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  I will fight with all my might for you.  I will protect you
from the powers of evil.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  The worst "powers of evil" are in yourself, Gunhild!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Harshly.]  So be it then.  [Menacingly, with upstretched arm.]
But this I tell you--he shall bear his father's name!  And bear
it aloft in honour again!  My son's heart shall be mine--mine
and no other's.

    [She goes out by the tapestry door and shuts it behind her.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Shaken and shattered.]  Borkman, Erhart's life will be wrecked
in this storm.  There must be an understanding between you and
Gunhild.  We must go down to her at once.

BORKMAN.
  [Looking at her.]  We?  I too, do you mean?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Both you and I.

BORKMAN.
  [Shaking his head.]  She is hard, I tell you.  Hard as the metal
I once dreamed of hewing out of the rocks.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Then try it now!

    [BORKMAN does not answer, but stands looking doubtfully at her.



ACT THIRD


    MRS. BORKMAN's drawing room.  The lamp is still burning on
        the table beside the sofa in front.  The garden-room at
        the back is quite dark.

    MRS. BORKMAN, with the shawl still over her head, enters, in
        violent agitation, by the hall door, goes up to the window,
        draws the curtain a little aside, and looks out; then she
        seats herself beside the stove, but immediately springs
        up again, goes to the bell-pull and rings.  Stands beside
        the sofa, and waits a moment.  No one comes.  Then she
        rings again, this time more violently.

    THE MAID presently enters from the hall.  She looks sleepy
        and out of temper, and appears to have dressed in great
