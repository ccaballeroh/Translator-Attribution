with mamma and auntie!  [To the ladies.]  Good-bye, good-bye Mrs.
Borkman!  Good-bye Miss Rentheim.

    [The ladies bow silently.  She goes toward the door.

ERHART.
  [Following her.]  Shan't I go a little bit of the way with you?

MRS. WILTON.
  [In the doorway, motioning him back.]  You shan't go a step
with me.  I am quite accustomed to taking my walks alone.  [Stops
on the threshold, looks at him and nods.]  But now beware, Mr.
Borkman--I warn you!

ERHART.
  What am I to beware of?

MRS. WILTON.
  [Gaily.]  Why, as I go down the road--deserted and forlorn, as
I said before--I shall try if I can't cast a spell upon you.

ERHART.
  [Laughing.]  Oh, indeed!  Are you going to try that again?

MRS. WILTON.
  [Half seriously.]  Yes, just you beware!  As I go down the road,
I will say in my own mind--right from the very centre of my will--
I will say: "Mr. Erhart Borkman, take your hat at once!"

MRS. BORKMAN.
  And you think he will take it?

MRS. WILTON.
  [Laughing.]  Good heavens, yes, he'll snatch up his hat
instantly.  And then I will say: "Now put on your overcoat, like
a good boy, Erhart Borkman!  And your goloshes!  Be sure you don't
forget the goloshes!  And then follow me!  Do as I bid you, as I
bid you, as I bid you!"

ERHART.
  [With forced gaiety.]  Oh, you may rely on that.

MRS. WILTON.
  [Raising her forefinger.]  As I bid you!  As I bid you!
Good-night!

    [She laughs and nods to the ladies, and closes the door
        behind her.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Does she really play tricks of that sort?

ERHART.
  Oh, not at all.  How can you think so!  She only says it in fun.
[Breaking off.]  But don't let us talk about Mrs. Wilton.  [He
forces ELLA RENTHEIM to seat herself at the armchair beside the
stove, then stands and looks at her.]  To think of your having
taken all this long journey, Aunt Ella!  And in winter too!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I found I had to, Erhart.

ERHART.
  Indeed?  Why so?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I had to come to town after all, to consult the doctors.

ERHART.
  Oh, I'm glad of that!

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Smiling.]  Are you glad of that?

ERHART.
  I mean I am glad you made up your mind to it at last.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [On the sofa, coldly.]  Are you ill, Ella?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looking hardly at her.]  You know quite well that I am ill.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  I knew you were not strong, and hadn't been for years.

ERHART.
  I told you before I left you that you ought to consult a doctor.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  There is no one in my neighbourhood that I have any real
confidence in.  And, besides, I did not feel it so much at
that time.

ERHART.
  Are you worse, then, Aunt?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, my dear boy; I am worse now.

ERHART.
  But there's nothing dangerous?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh, that depends how you look at it.

ERHART.
  [Emphatically.]  Well, then, I tell you what it is, Aunt Ella;
you mustn't think of going home again for the present.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  No, I am not thinking of it.

ERHART.
  You must remain in town; for here you can have your choice of
all the best doctors.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  That was what I thought when I left home.

ERHART.
  And then you must be sure and find a really nice place to live--
quiet, comfortable rooms.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I went this morning to the old ones, where I used to stay before.

ERHART.
  Oh, well, you were comfortable enough there.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, but I shall not be staying there after all.

ERHART.
  Indeed?  Why not?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I changed my mind after coming out here.

ERHART.
  [Surprised.]  Really?  Changed you mind?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Crocheting; without looking up.]  Your aunt will live here, in
her own house, Erhart.

ERHART.
  [Looking from one to the other alternately.]  Here, with us?  Is
this true, Aunt?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Yes, that is what I made up my mind to do.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [As before.]  Everything here belongs to your aunt, you know.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  I intend to remain here, Erhart--just now--for the present.
I shall set up a little establishment of my own, over in the
bailiff's wing.

ERHART.
  Ah, that's a good idea.  There are plenty of rooms there.  [With
sudden vivacity.]  But, by-the-bye, Aunt--aren't you very tired
after your journey?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  Oh yes, rather tired.

ERHART.
  Well, then, I think you ought to go quite early to bed.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  [Looks at him smilingly.]  I mean to.

ERHART.
  [Eagerly.]  And then we could have a good long talk to-morrow--
or some other day, of course--about this and that--about things
in general--you and mother and I.  Wouldn't that be much the
best plan, Aunt Ella?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With an outburst, rising from the sofa.]  Erhart, I can see you
are going to leave me!

ERHART.
  [Starts.]  What do you mean by that?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  You are going down to--to the Hinkels'?

ERHART.
  [Involuntarily.]  Oh, that!  [Collecting himself.]  Well, you
wouldn't have me sit here and keep Aunt Ella up half the night?
Remember, she's an invalid, mother.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  You are going to the Hinkels', Erhart!
