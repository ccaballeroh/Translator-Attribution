  It wants to come up into the light of day and serve mankind.
     [He paces up and down the gallery, always with his hands
        behind his back.

FRIDA.
  [Sits waiting a little, then looks at her watch and rises.]
I beg your pardon, Mr. Borkman; but I am afraid I must go.

BORKMAN.
  [Stopping before her.]  Are you going already?

FRIDA.
  [Putting her music in its case.]  I really must.  [Visibly
embarrassed.]  I have an engagement this evening.

BORKMAN.
  For a party?

FRIDA.
  Yes.

BORKMAN.
  And you are to play before the company?

FRIDA.
  [Biting her lip.]  No; at least I am only to play for dancing.

BORKMAN.
  Only for dancing?

FRIDA.
  Yes; there is to be a dance after supper.

BORKMAN.
  [Stands and looks at her.]  Do you like playing dance music?
At parties, I mean?

FRIDA.
  [Putting on her outdoor things.]  Yes, when I can get an
engagement.  I can always earn a little in that way.

BORKMAN.
  [With interest.]  Is that the principal thing in your mind as
you sit playing for the dancers?

FRIDA.
  No; I'm generally thinking how hard it is that I mayn't join
in the dance myself.

BORKMAN.
  [Nodding.]  That is just what I wanted to know.  [Moving
restlessly about the room.]  Yes, yes, yes.  That you must not
join in the dance, that is the hardest thing of all.  [Stopping.]
But there is one thing that should make up to you for that, Frida.

FRIDA.
  [Looking inquiringly at him.]  What is that, Mr. Borkman?

BORKMAN.
  The knowledge that you have ten times more music in you than
all the dancers together.

FRIDA.
  [Smiling evasively.]  Oh, that's not at all so certain.

BORKMAN.
  [Holding up his fore-finger warningly.]  You must never be so
mad as to have doubts of yourself!

FRIDA.
  But since no one knows it----

BORKMAN.
  So long as you know it yourself, that is enough.  Where is it
you are going to play this evening?

FRIDA.
  Over at the Hinkel's.

BORKMAN.
  [With a swift, keen glance at her.]  Hinkel's, you say!

FRIDA.
  Yes.

BORKMAN.
  [With a cutting smile.]  Does that man give parties?  Can he
get people to visit him?

FRIDA.
  Yes, they have a great many people about them, Mrs. Wilton says.

BORKMAN.
  [Vehemently.]  But what sort of people?  Can you tell me that?

FRIDA.
  [A little nervously.]  No, I really don't know.  Yes, by-the-bye,
I know that young Mr. Borkman is to be there this evening.

BORKMAN.
  [Taken aback.]  Erhart?  My son?

FRIDA.
  Yes, he is going there.

BORKMAN.
  How do you know that?

FRIDA.
  He said so himself--an hour ago.

BORKMAN.
  Is he out here to-day?

FRIDA.
  Yes, he has been at Mrs. Wilton's all the afternoon.

BORKMAN.
  [Inquiringly.]  Do you know if he called here too?  I mean, did
he see any one downstairs?

FRIDA.
  Yes, he looked in to see Mrs. Borkman.

BORKMAN.
  [Bitterly.]  Aha--I might have known it.

FRIDA.
  There was a strange lady calling upon her, I think.

BORKMAN.
  Indeed?  Was there?  Oh yes, I suppose people do come now and
then to see Mrs. Borkman.

FRIDA.
  If I meet young Mr. Borkman this evening, shall I ask him to
come up and see you too?

BORKMAN.
  [Harshly.]  You shall do nothing of the sort!  I won't have it
on any account.  The people who want to see me can come of their
own accord.

FRIDA.
  Oh, very well; I shan't say anything then.  Good-night, Mr.
Borkman.

BORKMAN.
  [Pacing up and down and growling.]  Good-night.

FRIDA.
  Do you mind if I run down by the winding stair?  It's the
shortest way.

BORKMAN.
  Oh, by all means; take whatever stair you please, so far as I
am concerned.  Good-night to you!

FRIDA.
  Good-night, Mr. Borkman.

    [She goes out by the little tapestry door in the back on
        the left.

    [BORKMAN, lost in thought, goes up to the piano, and is about
        to close it, but changes his mind.  Looks round the great
        empty room, and sets to pacing up and down it from the
        corner at the back on the right--pacing backward and
        forward uneasily and incessantly.  At last he goes up
        to the writing-table, listens in the direction of the
        folding door, hastily snatches up a hand-glass, looks
        at himself in it, and straightens his necktie.

    [A knock at the folding door.  BORKMAN hears it, looks rapidly
        towards the door, but says nothing.

    [In a little there comes another knock, this time louder.

BORKMAN.
  [Standing beside the writing-table with his left hand resting
upon it, and his right thrust in the breast of his coat.]  Come
in!

    [VILHELM FOLDAL comes softly into the room.  He is a bent
        and worn man with mild blue eyes and long, thin grey hair
        straggling down over his coat collar.  He has a portfolio
        under his arm, a soft felt hat, and large horn spectacles,
        which he pushes up over his forehead.

BORKMAN.
  [Changes his attitude and looks at FOLDAL with a half
disappointed, half pleased expression.]  Oh, is it only you?

FOLDAL.
  Good evening, John Gabriel.  Yes, you see it is me.

BORKMAN.
