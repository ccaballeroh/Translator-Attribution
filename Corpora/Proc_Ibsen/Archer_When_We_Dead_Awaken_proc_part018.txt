work--


PROFESSOR RUBEK. --And taken the train out to the lake--to stay there
over Sunday--


IRENE.

[With an evil gleam of hatred in her eyes.] It was an episode, Arnold.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[As if not hearing.] Then, too, you used to set birds swimming in the
brook. They were water-lilies which you--


IRENE.

They were white swans.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

I meant swans, yes. And I remember that I fastened a great furry leaf to
one of the swans. It looked like a burdock-leaf--


IRENE.

And then it turned into Lohengrin's boat--with the swan yoked to it.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

How fond you were of that game, Irene.


IRENE.

We played it over and over again.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

Every single Saturday, I believe,--all the summer through.


IRENE.

You said I was the swan that drew your boat.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

Did I say so? Yes, I daresay I did. [Absorbed in the game.] Just see how
the sea-gulls are swimming down the stream!


IRENE.

[Laughing.] And all your ships have run ashore.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[Throwing more leaves into the brook.] I have ships enough in reserve.
[Follows the leaves with his eyes, throws more into the brook, and says
after a pause.] Irene,--I have bought the little peasant hut beside the
Lake of Taunitz.


IRENE.

Have you bought it? You often said you would, if you could afford it.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

The day came when I could afford it easily enough; and so I bought it.


IRENE.

[With a sidelong look at him.] Then do you live out there now--in our
old house?


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

No, I have had it pulled down long ago. And I have built myself a great,
handsome, comfortable villa on the site--with a park around it. It is
there that we-- [Stops and corrects himself.] --there that I usually
live during the summer.


IRENE.

[Mastering herself.] So you and--and the other one live out there now?


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[With a touch of defiance.] Yes. When my wife and I are not
travelling--as we are this year.


IRENE.

[Looking far before her.] Life was beautiful, beautiful by the Lake of
Taunitz.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[As though looking back into himself.] And yet, Irene--


IRENE.

[Completing his thought.] --yet we two let slip all that life and its
beauty.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[Softly, urgently.] Does repentance come too late, now?


IRENE.

[Does not answer, but sits silent for a moment; then she points over
the upland.] Look there, Arnold,--now the sun is going down behind the
peaks. See what a red glow the level rays cast over all the heathery
knolls out yonder.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[Looks where she is pointing.] It is long since I have seen a sunset in
the mountains.


IRENE.

Or a sunrise?


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

A sunrise I don't think I have ever seen.


IRENE.

[Smiles as though lost in recollection.] I once saw a marvellously
lovely sunrise.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

Did you? Where was that?


IRENE.

High, high up on a dizzy mountain-top.--You beguiled me up there by
promising that I should see all the glory of the world if only I--

    [She stops suddenly.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

If only you--? Well?


IRENE.

I did as you told me--went with you up to the heights. And there I
fell upon my knees and worshipped you, and served you. [Is silent for a
moment; then says softly.] Then I saw the sunrise.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[Turning at him with a scornful smile.] With you--and the other woman?


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[Urgently.] With me--as in our days of creation. You could open all that
is locked up in me. Can you not find it in your heart, Irene?


IRENE.

[Shaking her head.] I have no longer the key to you, Arnold.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

You have the key! You and you alone possess it! [Beseechingly.] Help
me--that I may be able to live my life over again!


IRENE.

[Immovable as before.] Empty dreams! Idle--dead dreams. For the life you
and I led there is no resurrection.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[Curtly, breaking off.] Then let us go on playing.


IRENE.

Yes, playing, playing--only playing!

    [They sit and strew leaves and petals over the brook, where they
       float and sail away.

    [Up the slope to the left at the back come ULFHEIM and MAIA in
       hunting costume.  After them comes the SERVANT with the leash
       of dogs, with which he goes out to the right.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[Catching sight of them.] Ah! There is little Maia, going out with the
bear-hunter.


IRENE.

Your lady, yes.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

Or the other's.


MAIA.

[Looks around as she is crossing the upland, sees the two sitting by
the brook, and calls out.] Good-night, Professor! Dream of me. Now I am
going off on my adventures!


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[Calls back to her.] What sort of an adventure is this to be?


MAIA.

[Approaching.] I am going to let life take the place of all the rest.


PROFESSOR RUBEK.

[Mockingly.] Aha! So you too are going to do that, little Maia?


MAIA.

Yes. And I've made a verse about it, and this is how it goes:

    [Sings triumphantly.]

              I am free!  I am free!  I am free!
              No more life in the prison for me!
