        haste.


MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Impatiently.]  What has become of you, Malena?  I have rung
for you twice!

THE MAID.
  Yes, ma'am, I heard you.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  And yet you didn't come?


THE MAID.
  [Sulkily.]  I had to put some clothes on first, I suppose.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, you must dress yourself properly, and then you must run and
fetch my son.

THE MAID.
  [Looking at her in astonishment.]  You want me to fetch Mr.
Erhart?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes; tell him he must come home to me at once; I want to speak
to him.

THE MAID.
  [Grumbling.]  Then I'd better go to the bailiff's and call up
the coachman.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Why?

THE MAID.
  To get him to harness the sledge.  The snow's dreadful to-night.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Oh, that doesn't matter; only make haste and go.  It's just round
the corner.

THE MAID.
  Why, ma'am you can't call that just round the corner!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Of course it is.  Don't you know Mr. Hinkel's villa?

THE MAID.
  [With malice.]  Oh, indeed!  It's there Mr. Erhart is this
evening?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Taken aback.]  Why, where else should he be?

THE MAID.
  [With a slight smile.]  Well, I only thought he might be where
he usually is.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Where do you mean?

THE MAID.
  At Mrs. Wilton's, as they call her.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Mrs. Wilton's?  My son isn't so often there.

THE MAID.
  [Half muttering.]  I've heard say as he's there every day of
his life.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  That's all nonsense, Malena.  Go straight to Mr. Hinkel's and
try to to get hold of him.

THE MAID.
  [With a toss of her head.]  Oh, very well; I'm going.

    [She is on the point of going out by the hall, but just at
        that moment the hall door is opened, and ELLA RENTHEIM
        and BORKMAN appear on the threshold.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Staggers a step backwards.]  What does this mean?

THE MAID.
  [Terrified, instinctively folding her hands.]  Lord save us!

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Whispers to THE MAID.]  Tell him he must come this instant.

THE MAID.
  [Softly.]  Yes, ma'am.

    [ELLA RENTHEIM and, after her, BORKMAN enter the room.  THE
        MAID sidles behind them to the door, goes out, and closes
        it after her.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Having recovered her self-control, turns to ELLA.]  What does
he want down here in my room?

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  He wants to come to an understanding with you, Gunhild.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  He has never tried that before.

ELLA RENTHEIM.
  He is going to, this evening.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  The last time we stood face to face--it was in the Court, when
I was summoned to give an account----

BORKMAN.
  [Approaching.]  And this evening it is _I_ who will give an
account of myself.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Looking at him.]  You?

BORKMAN.
  Not of what I have done amiss.  All the world knows that.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With a bitter sigh.]  Yes, that is true; all the world knows
that.

BORKMAN.
  But it does not know why I did it; why I had to do it.  People
do not understand that I had to, because I was myself--because I
was John Gabriel Borkman--myself, and not another.  And that is
what I will try to explain to you.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [Shaking her head.]  It is of no use.  Temptations and promptings
acquit no one.

BORKMAN.
  They may acquit one in one's own eyes.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  [With a gesture of repulsion.]  Oh, let all that alone!  I have
thought over that black business of yours enough and to spare.

BORKMAN.
  I too.  During those five endless years in my cell--and elsewhere
--I had time to think it over.  And during the eight years up there
in the gallery I have had still more ample time.  I have re-tried
the whole case--by myself.  Time after time I have re-tried it.  I
have been my own accuser, my own defender, and my own judge.  I
have been more impartial than any one else could be--that I venture
to say.  I have paced up and down the gallery there, turning every
one of my actions upside down and inside out.  I have examined them
from all sides as unsparingly, as pitilessly, as any lawyer of them
all.  And the final judgment I have always come to is this: the one
person I have sinned against is--myself.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  And what about me?  What about your son?

BORKMAN.
  You and he are included in what I mean when I say myself.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  And what about the hundreds of others, then--the people you are
said to have ruined?

BORKMAN.
  [More vehemently.]  I had power in my hands!  And then I felt
the irresistible vocation within me!  The prisoned millions lay
all over the country, deep in the bowels of the earth, calling
aloud to me!  They shrieked to me to free them!  But no one else
heard their cry--I alone had ears for it.

MRS. BORKMAN.
  Yes, to the branding of the name of Borkman.

BORKMAN.
  If the others had had the power, do you think they would not
have acted exactly as I did?

MRS. BORKMAN.
  No one, no one but you would have done it!

BORKMAN.
  Perhaps not.  But that would have been because they had not my
brains.  And if they had done it, it would not have been with my
